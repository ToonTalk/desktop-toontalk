box.htm	
// added the following at the end
<B>Advanced tip.</B> You can also use blank boxes to &quot;explode&quot;
a text pad. If you drop a text pad like &quot;cat&quot; on a blank
box the box will turn into one with 3 holes. The first hole will
contain just the letter &quot;c&quot;, the second hole &quot;a&quot;,
and the third hole &quot;t&quot;. 

command.htm	
// added at the end:
<LI>-tts_uses_ds &lt;0,1&gt; 1 means the text-to-speech engine uses DirectSound.  It enables simultaneous speech and sound effects.  The default, however, is 0 since on many systems it introduces sentence long delays and a background hiss.  This is only for the 32-bit version.  Try it and see how it works on your system.</LI></UL>

You (or a robot you've trained) can drop a different picture (or a number or text pad) here and the picture will be covered by the new picture. Great for making objects explode or numbers that change as the score changes or thousands of other neat uses.
