Hi, Ken!

Sorry for taking so much time to reply, but I had lots of problems with my computer. The
Netscape Mail was throwing away all the messages that had attachments! Now I think the
problem is solved.

Here are my current remarks:

* In the file TTUS.RC, I would recommend replacing the sentence ‘com um chapéu’ by ‘com
chapéu’

* Marty explanation differs depending on if you are holding the object, if the object is
in the toolbox or if it is on the floor. When you hold a bomb, a robot, or a truck, the
explanation is incomplete and very fast. The same thing happens when these objects are
inside the toolbox.

* When we point to the button on Dusty’s chest, Marty explains all he knows about ‘the
picture of a button’. Isn’t that weird?

* I couldn’t read the LOG files. Would you tell me again how to do that?

* Concerning the puzzles, I do not know what to do. One option is to present them
myself. Another would be to record my voice (how did you do that? -- I think that would
be very interesting for teachers to create their own scenarios...). A third option is to
have Marty explaining everything.

* When do you think you could provide me with a new CD so I would be able to generate
instalation diskettes?

* Other remarks are writen in the file PORT.RC after ‘// ---‘ (2 slashes and 3 dashes)

Looking forward to hearing from again,

Leo
