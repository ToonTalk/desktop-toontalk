Hi.  Happy New Year!  I hope you had a nice vacation.  

The fellow who translated ToonTalk to Swedish suggested that
it might be useful for you all to communicate via email.  If
that's fine with you I'll send your email address to the others
and if its ok with the others I'll send you their email addresses.

I was working on generating the Portuguese version of the program
that starts ToonTalk (gives the user a choice of playing the game,
free play or demos) but I couldn't find the file.  Just in case, I am
attaching the file again to the end of this message.  It is an RC
file where again only the parts within "..." need be translated.

Also the following 3 sentences are spoken by ToonTalk.  If you could
record someone saying them as a WAV file that would be great.

Sorry, but the narration for this demo has not been installed.
OK.
OK, I'll pick one.

If I have all the files I need I should be able to make and send you
a CDROM next week.  How's that?

Thanks again,

  -ken
