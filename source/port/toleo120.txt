 IDS_SCALE_TO_RIGHT,
  "uma balança inclinada para a direita" // --- (970120) This text is being displayed with na extra ")"

IDS_WHICH_IS_PARTLY_VISIBLE,
 "que está parcialmente visível" //--- (970120) This text is also being shown with an extra ")"

Couldn't reproduce this.

----------
IDS_EXPANDER_KEY_COMMANDS,
 "BTWLSNG" // --- (970119) I'm gonna wait for the next version before translating these and the other KEY_COMMANDAS, Ok?

Sure.  They won't be easy to remember but there's no big problem.

-------------------

 IDS_IS,
  " is "  // --- (970119) "is" something, or "is" doing something?

Ken:
 IDS_IS, // as in "Under the wand is a number." and "Inside a computer 6 is 110 in binary."

------

IDS_VISIBLE_REMOTE_STATE1,
       "VER TUDO" // --- (970119) Where/when are these sentences used?

Ken:
// the remote control for the visibility of a picture
// can display one of the following states:
// In other words -- Marty doesn't say these they show up on the 
// remote control.

IDS_VISIBLE_REMOTE_STATE1,
   "SEE ALL"
IDS_VISIBLE_REMOTE_STATE2,
   "SEE SOME"
IDS_VISIBLE_REMOTE_STATE3,
   "SEE NOTHING"

Note also that these have been moved to sensors.rc so that the
system is able to show saved sensors in the language of the version
they were saved in.

----------

IDS_VK_LEFT,
 "Seta para a esquerda" // --- (970119) On the keyboards here these keys are not labeled. They simply have an arrow to each direction on top of them. What should I put?

Ken: I would put a short description of the key.  If what you have here is
equivalent to "Left arrow" then it is fine as is.

Note that these too have been moved tos sensors.rc

------

IDS_TOONTALK_VERSION_NUMBER,
  "Beta Version 6." // --- (970119) I'm not going to translate the version number, nor the start token

IDS_UUENCODING_START_TOKEN,
  "4!@%!(%@" 

Ken: The IDS_UUENCODING_START_TOKEN has been moved to common.rc (strings that
are not language dependent).  

The version number is now 6.  When pasting ToonTalk objects into an
editor the comments will say it was "Beta Version 6.".  I assume that's ok.

------

 IDS_BOMB_USED_HOUSE_HELP4,
  "Você pode se sentar em segurança clicando em " // --- (970119) I never saw the remaining of this sentence in ToonTalk

Ken: This sentence is finished by "any mouse button."
(or if you have -b 2 or 3 then it will say "the left mouse button.")
It is said if you have never used a bomb before or if you pressed F1
while holding or pointing to a bomb.

By the way, when describing bombs inside thought bubbles Marty would 
add an extra "any mouse button".  Fixed now.  Also Marty now also 
explains that the space bar will set off bombs.

-----------

IDS_CUBBY_BAD_CONTENTS_ABORT, 
  "he tried to put something in a box that doesn't go" // --- (970119) I did not understand what "a box that doesn't go" means

Ken: Yes that wasn't the best wording.  The new version is:

 IDS_CUBBY_BAD_CONTENTS_ABORT,
 // as in "A robot stopped because he tried to put something in a box that can't be put in boxes."
// was  "he tried to put something in a box that doesn't go"
  "he tried to put something in a box that can't be put in boxes"

--------------------
 IDS_WHOSE,
  " cujo " // --- (970120) I think that the use of too many "whose" makes the sentence hard to read and boring. My suggestion is to simply tell that the robot expects a box whose: 1st hole contains something, the 2nd hole contains other stuff, ... Ie. list the contents of the holes separated by commas ...

Ken: A good idea.  My only reservation is whether kids are comfortable
with colons like this.  I'll ask around.  Thanks for the suggestion.
Other translators -- any opinion?

---------
 IDS_AND_BEGIN_SENTENCE,
  "E" // --- (970120) In my opinion, the use of too many sentences starting with "E" is very repetitive and boring. Why not join all the sentences together separating them with a simple ","?

Ken: Another good idea. Generally long sentences are to be avoided
but these would have a simple structure so it should be ok.
I'll bounce it off some people to get more opinions. 
Other translators -- any opinion?

-----------
 IDS_SEND_TO,
  "empurrar" // --- (970119) When is this used?

Ken:
 IDS_SEND_TO, // as in "He will push the 'a' key."

This is used to describe robot's who send key strokes to things they
are holding (e.g. a text pad).  Used to say "send the letter 'a' to
the text pad..." but that was too confusing.

--------
 IDS_LABEL_CHARACTER,
  "adicionar" // --- (970119) when/where is this used?
 IDS_CHARACTER_AND_SELECT,
  "empurrar" // --- (970119) when/where is this used?

Ken: these are also used to describe a robot that types things.

// e.g. "If given a box like that he will push '9' after moving
// to the first hole of the box he's working on.  And push '7' while
// pointing to the first hole of the box he's working on."
// or
// "If given a box like that he will push 'B'
// while pointing to the first hole of the box he's working on.  And push
// 'C' while pointing to the first hole of the box he's working on.  And
// add 'L' to the label of the first hole of the box he's working on."

----------
 IDS_DESTROY_HOUSE,
  "tiver estourado a casa em que ele estiver" // --- (970119) when/where is this used?

 IDS_DESTROY_HOUSE,
  // As in "And pick up a bomb.  And use it.  And have blown up the house he's in."
 // I admit not the best way to say this.
  "have blown up the house he's in"

---------
 IDS_PICT_CHANGED_KEY_HELP,
  "This picture is really " // --- (970119) Where/when?

Ken:  For example, pick up a picture of the person walking on page 8
of the Pictures notebook.

 IDS_PICT_CHANGED_KEY_HELP,
  // as in "This picture is really 8 pictures."
  "This picture is really "
 IDS_PICT_CHANGED_KEY_HELP2,
 // as in " You can switch between them by pressing the +, -, or space button when selected or held."
  "You can switch between them "
 IDS_PICT_CHANGED_KEY_HELP3,
 // as in "Some pictures can be changed by pressing the +, -, or space button when selected or held. "
  "Some pictures can be changed "

-----------
 IDS_PICT_TOSSED_HELP,
  "You can give this a toss by pressing " // --- (970119) What is this for?
 IDS_PICT_TOSSED_HELP2,
  "You can toss a picture by pressing " // ---

Ken: If you pick up a picture you can give it an initial speed as
described below:

 IDS_PICT_TOSSED_HELP,
  // as in "You can give this a toss by pressing control while releasing the button."
  // the word "this" should always refer to a picture of something.
  "You can give this a toss by pressing "
 IDS_PICT_TOSSED_HELP2,
  "You can toss a picture by pressing "

---------
 IDS_BE_WOP_SOUND,
  "Be Wop" // --- (970119)
 IDS_BE_YAW_SOUND,
  "Be Yaw" // ---
 IDS_SPIRAL_IN_SOUND,
  "Spiral In" // ---
 IDS_SPIRAL_OUT_SOUND,
  "Spiral Out" // ---

Ken:  These are just the best names I could come up with for these
strange souunds.  The first 2 approximate how they sound.  The next
two describe how the sound changes. Did you try them? 

-----------

IDS_THOUSANDS_COMMA,
 "." // --- (970119) In Brazil, one thousand is written like 1.000,00 , not 1,000.00

Ken: There are only integers in ToonTalk and due to the above one thousand
is "1.000". 
When there are floating point numbers I'll have to add the comma.

--------------
IDS_WHAT_IS_ON_TOP_OF,
  "o que estiver por cima de" // --- (970119) Here we have our old problem. The "of" of "on top of" will have different translations depending on the word that follows it

Ken:
IDS_WHAT_IS_ON_TOP_OF,
  // as in "He will then pick up what is on top of the nest."
  "what is on top of"

Turns out that it will always refer to a nest.

------

IDS_BETA_TO_EXPIRE_SOON,
  "Já é hora de obter uma nova versão do ToonTalk. Estaversão beta deixará de funcionar dia primeiro de março." // --- (970119) Is March 1st still valid?

For Beta 6 it is April 1.  For your CDROM I can add a few months.  Does
July 1 sound ok for that?

-------------------------
IDS_IN,
 "in" // --- (970119) Again, "in" will have different translations depending on the word that follow it

Ken: This OK?

IDS_IN,
 // used only when describing robots that either give things
 // to birds that are in boxes or put things in boxes that
 // are in trucks.
 // "He will give it to the bird in the first hole of the box." or
 // "He will drop it on the box in the truck."
 "in"

-------------
IDS_USE,
  "use" // --- (970119) Who is the subjetc of this verb? Is it in the infinitive?

Ken: Only used as a noun.  See below:

IDS_WHICH_HAS_ENOUGH_MAGIC,
 // Together with the following words is used in
 // "You are holding a magic wand which has enough magic for 4 uses."
 "which has enough magic for"
IDS_USE,
  "use"
IDS_USES,
  "uses"

---------------
IDS_SOMETHING_IS_MISSING,
 "Algo está faltando do/da" // --- (970119) Two things here. In Portuguese this sentence would become "Something from" + something + "is missing". And the "from" will have different translations depending on the word that follows it

Ken:
Since it turns out the "something" is always "the box" I've changed it
as follows:

IDS_SOMETHING_IS_MISSING,
// was  "Something is missing from"
 "Something is missing from the box. "


------------------
IDS_THAT_IS_READY_TO,
 "que está pronto para" // --- (970119) The word "ready" will have different translations depending on the object that is ready

Ken:  It used to use the word "ready" but is used as follows now:

IDS_THAT_IS_READY_TO,
  // only used to describe a magic wand
  // following expressions are IDS_COPIER_STATE0, IDS_COPIER_STATE1, or
  // IDS_COPIER_STATE2
 "that can"

---------
IDS_BUTTON_HELP_GIVEN_HELP4,
"if you pick it up." // --- (970119) "it"may have different translations depending on the noun it refers to
IDS_BUTTON_HELP_GIVEN_HELP5,
"if you pick him up." // --- (970119) Same as above

Ken:
IDS_BUTTON_HELP_GIVEN_HELP4 is only used for wands. 
IDS_BUTTON_HELP_GIVEN_HELP5 is used for Pumpy and Dusty

IDS_BUTTON_HELP_GIVEN_HELP4,
  // only used for wands now.
  // as in "I'll tell you more about magic wands if you pick it up."
"if you pick it up."
IDS_BUTTON_HELP_GIVEN_HELP5,
  // as in "I'll tell you more about bike pumps if you pick him up."
"if you pick him up."

Is this OK?

--------

IDS_TURN_IT_ON_HELP,
"Você também pode ligá-lo ou desligá-lo apertando a barra de espaço enquanto o estiver segurando." // --- (970120) "Turn him on/off" will also have different translations the magic wand is female and Dusty is a male word... One possible solution for this problem would be to have all characters converted to the same sex. Other would be to have each situaion defined in separate 

Ken:  I've been using male pronouns for Dusty and Pumpy and neuter for the
wand.  This entry like the earlier one is split into 2 categories: one
for both the bike pump and vacuum and the other for the wand.

----------
IDS_ON, // added 12/3
 "no"  // --- (970119) as in "use Pumpy on" --> we have the same gender problem here

Ken:
Only used for Pumpy.  If things change we'll have to address this.

----------------
THE_LEFT_PAGE_OF, // added 12/13
"a página à esquerda de" // --- (970119) We may find gender problems here. Where is this used?
THE_RIGHT_PAGE_OF, // added 12/13
"a página à direita de" // --- (970119) Same as above

Ken:

THE_LEFT_PAGE_OF, // added 12/13
// should always be of some notebook
// as in "If given a box like that he will pick up what's on
// "the left page of the main notebook."
"the left page of"

-------------
 IDS_NUMBER_TYPE_PRONOUN,
 "para ele" // --- (970119) In order to check if this translation is ok I'll need to know where/when each of these pronouns are used. I assumed something like "give" + pronoun + "something". If this is so, than we have a problem. In Portuguese, instead of "give somebody something", we use "give something to somebody"

Ken:  Currently pronouns are only used in 3 places in ToonTalk:
1.  When Marty says "You are holding a number pad.  You can drop it by
clicking any mouse button."

2. "You are pointing to a button of a magic wand.  You can change it
to do something different if you click on the button."

3. "You are pointing to a number pad.  You can grab it
by clicking on any mouse button."

Do these uses cause any problems?

-------------
 IDS_STACK_OF_PRONOUN, // added 12/21
  "it" // --- (970119) Where/when is this used?

IDS_PICT_OF_PRONOUN, // added 12/21
 "it" // --- (970119) Where/when is this used?
IDS_MOVIE_OF_PRONOUN,  // added 12/21
 "it" // --- (970119) Where/when is this used?
IDS_BLANK_PICTURE_OF_PRONOUN, // added 12/21
 "it" // --- (970119) Where/when is this used?

Ken: Just those 3 types of sentences above. (#2 won't occur for these.)

-------------
IDS_THING_ON_THE_BACK1,
  "o" // --- (970119) On the back of what? Of the queue, of the picture?
IDS_THING_ON_THE_BACK2,
  "objeto que está atrás " // as in "The third thing on the back is a robot."

Ken:
Just used to talk about what's on the back of pictures.  Since some pictures
are animation cycles they are sometimes refered to as movies.

------------
IDS_PAGE_OF1,
 "a" // --- (970119) Here we also have a gender problem. We would need a female 'first', 'second', ... in order to address 'page', that is a female noun. I would recommend something like "page 1 of the notebook", "page 2 ..." in order to avoid this problem. Another solution would be o have all the adjectives and articles written in their female, male, singular and plural formats.  
 // as in "the first page of the notebook"
IDS_PAGE_OF2,
 "page of" // --- Waiting for the above

Ken: Thanks for pointing this out.  This problem is currently limited
to ordinal numbers but it does occur often (e.g. "The third hole of
the box...").  I think the right solution is as you say to have the
female, male, singular and plural forms.  That is a bit of work.
Here's what I'm planning.  Keep the current scheme for languages like
English (and Swedish? German?) where this isn't an issue and follow
your suggestion about "page 1" or "hole 1" for the other languages.
This is now on my "to do list".

---
IDS_HOLE_OF1,
 "o"
IDS_HOLE_OF2,
 "buraco da" // --- (970119) Another place with the gender problem (every time we use 'of' is the same). A solution for this case would be to have 'of' always associated with a noun. That would change 'hole of' + 'the box' to 'hole'+ 'of the box'

Ken: Another good suggestion.  Will look into it.

---------
 IDS_EXPANDER_APPLY, // added 12/3
  "use o Pumpy" // --- (970119) Is to use Pumpy or use Pumpy to do something?

Ken:
 IDS_EXPANDER_APPLY, // added 12/3
 // e.g. "The robot will robot use Pumpy for 100 milliseconds on the box."
  "use Pumpy"

-----------

Thanks for all the comments.  They really help.
