//All of the phrases from IDS_MOVE_TO to IDS_APPLY_GRASPED_NEST

The problems you mentioned regarding

IDS_NEW
IDS_FIRST_NEW
IDS_NEWEST
IDS_TO_LAST

are resolved by removing them.  (They are still used in the
English version.)  This means that when Marty is describing
what a robot does he may say less natural things such as "the
fourth thing made or found" rather than "the new number" if
the system knows that it is a number and it is new.  I think
this is low priority so for now it'll fall back on the more
generic descriptions.

IDS_WHATS_ON,
 // as in "The robot picks up what's on the third page of the notebook."
 // NOTE:  This currently is only used as part of something that
 // refers to a page of a notebook.  If ever used for more may
 // have different translation
 "what's on"
IDS_WHATS_IN,
 // as in "The robot picks up what's in the second hole of the box."
 // NOTE:  This currently is only used as part of something that
 // refers to a hole of a box.  If ever used for more may
 // have different translation
 "what's in"


// added the following

IDS_BLANK_PICTURE_OF_DEFINITE, // added 12/20

IDS_BLANK_PICTURE_OF_PLURAL, // added 12/20
 "blank pictures of"
IDS_BLANK_PICTURE_OF, // revised on 12/20 (replaces the old IDS_BLANK_PICTURE)
 "a blank picture of"

IDS_OF
 "of" // --- 'of the notebook' would become 'do', 'of a ball' would be 'da', and 'of Dusty' would be 'do'

// I eliminated 
IDS_OF

IDS_NO_NAME_IS_YOUR_NAME,
 "Eu não peguei o seu nome. Dessa forma, agora eu vou chamar você de SemNome e salvar tudo o que você fizer sob este este nome. " // --- I substituted NoName by SemNome. Please replace this wherever it is used.

I added this to the RUL file.

#define STR_NO_NAME "SemNome"

IDS_THIS_TEXT_PAD,
 "This text pad is"  // as in  "This text pad is a remote control."
