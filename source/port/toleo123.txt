 IDS_BOMB_USED_HOUSE_HELP4,
  "Você pode se sentar em segurança clicando em " // --- (970122) The "on" will have different translations depending on what follows it. For "the left mouse button" we're gonna have to change this sentence ...

Ken:
 IDS_BOMB_USED_HOUSE_HELP4,
  "You can set it down safely by clicking on "

I think I should restructure these as
"You can set it down safely by " +  "clicking on the left mouse button" + "."
and
"You can set it down safely by " +  "clicking on any mouse button" + "."

On the to do list.

-------------------
IDS_NEW_MAIN_CUBBY,
  "ir trabalhar em" // --- (970122) These sentences may be gender dependent
IDS_COPIER_APPLY_NEST,
 "usar a varinha mágica em "  // --- (970122) 

Ken:

IDS_NEW_MAIN_CUBBY,
  "switch to working on" // always followed by a description of some box

IDS_COPIER_APPLY_NEST,
 "use the magic wand on"        
// this can be followed by nearly anything so a general solution
// to gender matching like you proposed on 1/21 is needed
// however in this case would it work to paraphrase this as
// "use the magic wand to copy"
// to avoid the problem with "on"?

--------------
 IDS_SCALE_KEYBOARD_HELP,
  "Quando uma balança estiver se equilibrando você poderá alterar o modo com que ela se inclina apertando a tecla de espaço. " // --- (970122) I didn't notice anything different. What should happen when I press the space bar?

// That was a bug that took most of the morning to fix. 
// Thanks for reporting it.
// The fix will be on your CDROM.
// The idea is that scales can be changed if they are totering
// or have blanks on both sides of them -- otherwise you would
// be constructing a contradiction.  Useful in thought bubbles.

-----------------------

IDS_WHAT_IS_ON_TOP_OF,
  "o que estiver por cima do" // --- (970122) In order to fix this sentence, we will need to use "on top of the" + "nest", instead of "on top of" + "the nest"

Ken:
I'm not sure I understand why this helps...

-------------------

IDS_TOONTALK_VERSION_NUMBER,
  "Beta Version 6." // (970122) But is this to be translated or not?

Ken:
I think we should leave it untranslated.  It means someone can
look at something from someone's clipboard and know which version
of ToonTalk is came from.

---------------
IDS_BETA_TO_EXPIRE_SOON,
  "Já é hora de obter uma nova versão do ToonTalk. Estaversão beta deixará de funcionar dia primeiro de julho." // --- (970122) I wrote down the dead line as July 1st. Isn't it better to write the date as a number (ie. 01/07/97) instead of having to change this file everytime?

Ken:  You are right.  Or since I have the names of months I could add
the month automatically and always end on the first of the month.  I think
this should work for most languuages (e.g. "... stop working on the first of"
+ month).

On the to do list.

--------------------------

IDS_IN,
 "no" // --- (970122) Again, "in" will have different translations depending on the word that follows it. I translated "in" to "in the", so "in" + "the truck" will have to be modified to "in the" + "truck". The same is gonna work for "hole". Is that ok for you?

Ken:
Do you mean that the translation of "in" depends upon the gender of the 
following noun phrase or that it depends upon which word (or words) follow
it?  I guess I'm reluctant to break it as you suggest since it is contrary
to grammar.  The "the" is part of the noun phrase "the truck".  If this
is just an issue of the gender of the following noun phrase I think I
should deal with gender properly instead.

------------
IDS_ON, // added 12/3
 "no"  // --- (970122) as in "use Pumpy on" --> we have the same gender problem here. The translation will differ depending on the gender of the object that Pumpy is being used on

Ken:
Again sounds like gender needs to be dealt with generally.

-------
// --- (970122) There is a way to structure the sentence
like in English, but it will require a few changes (ie. remove the
space between some of the words, and change the verbs that appears in
the infinitive). For example: "You can drop" + <space> + <pronoun> +
<space> + "by clicking a button" would become "Você pode largá-"
+ <pronoun> + <space> + "apertando um botão", where "largá-" is
a modified version of "largar" (to drop). If you think this would be
fine, please show me the verbs that are used in these phrases for me
to convert them. I have already changed all the pronouns and also a
few of the verbs (IDS_DROP_HELP, IDS_PICK_UP_HELP,
IDS_BUTTON_CLICKED_HELP1, IDS_BUTTON_CYCLE_HELP1) to this new
format. If any of these is wrong, please return it to the original
translation.

Ken:
Do I understand that the problem is that the form of the verb depends
upon the gender?  Or am I confused.

Your proposal would cause problems for other languages -- wouldn't it?

--------------------

THE_LEFT_PAGE_OF, // added 12/13
"a página à esquerda do" // --- (970122) I translated to "the left page of the". We will need to add "notebook", instead of "the notebook". Is this alright?
THE_RIGHT_PAGE_OF, // added 12/13
"a página à direita do" // --- (970122) Same as above

Ken:
Again this doesn't follow the grammatical structure very well
("noun phrase" -> [article noun]).  While languages differ
as to whether the article is attached to the noun or whether
it comes first or second in all languages it forms a grammatical
unit.

I would prefer a solution that have 2 forms of THE_LEFT_PAGE_OF
say THE_LEFT_PAGE_OF_FEMININE and THE_LEFT_PAGE_OF_MASCULINE.

----------------
IDS_BUILT_IN_SOUND_PRONOUN,
 "lo" // --- (970122) Where is this used?

In Beta 6 there is a new data type which are sounds.  They replace
the old scheme where text pads where used to sometimes name sounds.
The new data type looks like a text pad with a different color but
the operations on it are different.

--------
IDS_REMOTE_TEXT_PICTURE_TYPE_PRONOUN,
 "lo" // (970122) Where is this used?

For sensors, remote controls, and options (page 10) they sometimes
have a picture (like the collision sensor) and sometimes text (like
the one that controls how visible a picture is).  Internally they
are now different but Marty should refer to them the same so it should
be the same as
IDS_REMOTE_PICTURE_TYPE_PRONOUN,
 "la"

which they are not.  I think of them both as sensors/remote-controls which
happen to have different appearances (text vs. picture).  So they should
have the same pronoun, right?

---------------
Ken:

Regarding

IDS_ALPHABET_UPPER_CASE,
"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
IDS_ALPHABET_LOWER_CASE,
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

Does one say in Portuguese that there are 26 letters and some of those
letters have accents or are the accented letters thought of as distinct
letters?

This matters for a few of the puzzles and also if you drop the number 1
on a letter you get the next letter.  This isn't well defined right
now for accented letters.

On a related topic have you tried using scales to compare letters with
accents?  I think it should work OK...
