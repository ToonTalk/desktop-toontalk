Dear ToonTalk Beta 8A tester:

This program will extract the ToonTalk installation files.
(If you prefer you may use unzip to extract these files.)  
You should choose a temporary directory for the files.
When it is finished please run the program setup.exe.
When installation is complete you may delete beta8a16.exe
and the files on the temporary directory.

If you have any problems or don't know the password to
extract the files then please send mail to
KenKahn@ToonTalk.com

Thank you and good luck.
