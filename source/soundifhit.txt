   This is the result of "pasting" a ToonTalk object. You can include
this in files, email, or whatever. To decode it just use any program
that can copy this to the Windows clipboard. For example, you can use
Windows Notepad or WordPad program. Just be sure your selection includes
the code below and then select the Copy command in the Edit menu. 
Then it will appear in the ToonTalk remote control for the clipboard. 
You can find the clipboard remote control on page 30 of the Sensor notebook. 
Just use Dusty to vacuum it off the clipboard.
