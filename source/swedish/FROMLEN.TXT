I guess not. Talked to Torsten about it. I was going to Falun with
Tobias on Monday Nov 28 to talk about ToonTalk. A pretty big conference.
They faxed me today saying the whole thing was cancelled. The schools
didn't have the money to attend. That's pretty heavy.

We are now talking about seting up our own thing, both at Uppsala ADB
och datalogi and at Ekelunds. Your gig with Rolf is still OK.

This is not easy.
How about "T" for tunn (smal). And "H" for hög/lång.

You know "tall" in Swedish is actually vertical length as in "höghus", a
tall building, but "tall" also means "lång" as in a tall person.

That's all I can come up with at the moment!
