Hi Ken,
Snap shots well received, the second batch, that is. It 's interesting what
pictures do. More about that.
Ekelunds have closed down for the summer. This means the rush is even more
non existent than before. They will be back on line at the beginning of
August.

Back to the pictures, which were fine, but had som flaws in the talk bubbles.
* In the text "Goddagens Lotta. Det här är Marty." I think "Goddagens
Lotta. Jag heter Marty." would be more to the point in Swedish.
* In the text " Du håller talet 1. Du kan lägga ihop två tal genom att
släppa det ena på det andra. Du kan släppa den genom att trycka på någon"
"kan släppa den" should be "kan släppa det" since "det" is referring to
"talet 1".

There will be more revelations like these as we go along I think.

Tobias is looking forward to working with the Manual. It will be more
creative than working with the translations. He is going to work with TT ,
learn and write an outline in August.

I thought I'd have a go at the texts on your web pages where you address
different people according to their profession. Along with the page on
Thinking Skills that could make up a nice introductory segment in the
Manual.

I think you can send your mail to both Tobias and me. He'll give you the
mail addresses he can be reached at. The one you write to will be
considered the one who will reply. I will be away between July 11 and July
16, but that's about it.

Yours
Lennart
