<DL>
<DT><B>Plays music.</B>
<DD>ToonTalk can send messages to Microsoft Window's Media Control Interface (MCI). A cute example is <A HREF="../canyon.txt">Play Canyon</A> that has a picture of a switch. On the back is a robot who will play the file "canyon.mid" from the Windows directory when the switch is on and it is on the floor. 
<DT><A NAME="Primes"></A><A HREF="../primes.txt">Generates prime numbers</A>.
<DD>This is a notebook of robots that implement the Sieve of Erathosthenes. The best way to watch it to give the robot on page 2 a box with a bird in it and press F8 to stop all robots. Then get in the helicopter, press F8 to start them up again, and watch as first a house is built with a robot inside that gives a bird a 2, then 3, 4, 5 and so on. The bird takes it to her nest in a new house that has robots in it that passes along only numbers divisible by 2. When a number passes through all the existing houses then it is a prime and a new house is built filtering out numbers divisible by it. 
<DT><A NAME="SingleFactorial"></A><A HREF="../fact.txt">Recursive factorial</A>.
<DD>This is a notebook of robots that compute the product of numbers from 1 to n in a recursive fashion. One of the built-in demos of ToonTalk shows how to build an iterative factorial program. Those robots can be found in the <I>Examples</I> notebook on page 6 of your main notebook. This one is fun to watch from the outside. (Computer scientists should be able to recognize the stack from the helicopter.) 
<DT><A NAME="DoubleFactorial"></A><A HREF="../dfact.txt">Doubly recursive factorial.</A>
<DD>This computes the same values as the singly recursive version above, but if you watch from the outside you'll see a tree of houses grow and shrink. 
<DT><A HREF="../spinner.txt">A spinning person</A>.
<DD>This one a just a picture of a person spinning around. On the back is a robot that just repeatedly adds one to a parameter that controls which way she is facing. 
<DT><A HREF="../movies.txt">Chase movies.</A>
<DD>This uses the behavior notebook above to make 4 movies. The first one just has 2 characters bouncing off the edges. The second adds reversing on collision to the oval. The third one gives the oval the goal of moving to the center and also imposes a speed limit on it. The fourth gives the square the behavior of chasing the oval. It also gets a speed limit.
<DT><A NAME="Behaviors"></A><B>Neat behaviors.</B>
<DD>The chase movies were made by placing different behaviors on the back of geometric shapes. These behaviours were built in ToonTalk. They include drift towards a goal, bounce off edges, obey speed limit, chase another, and more and can be found in <A HREF="../behave.txt">this notebook</A>.
<DT><A HREF="../gates.txt">Logic gates.</A> <A NAME="LogicGates">
<DD>This was posted by Tyler Breisacher (age 11) who wrote the following.
Recently I've been getting interested in Digital Electronics. I
decided to see if I could train robots to act like a logic
gate. You'll notice the robots get input from nests give output to
birds. This is so that robots can deliver data to other robots which
is critical in making a logical circuit. As I make circuits from these
gates I will post some. I also need to make 3 and 4 input And/Or/Ex-Or
gates. I think this is a good use for birds/nests and for the
discussion group. Feel free to make logic circuits with these.</A>
