</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/27</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way pictures are copied.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now deals better with very small 
  things (e.g. things in boxes in thought bubbles in boxes in other boxes and so 
  on).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading scales saved in XML.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem dealing with saving empty text 
  pads in XML. (Rubbed out not erased.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of sensors that display 
  non-rectangular pictures.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you switch to saving in XML, visit an old 
  format city, and then save, the old city file was deleted. It is now renamed 
  to have the extension &quot;octy&quot;. Similarly for notebook files &quot;bok&quot; is renamed &quot;obok&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug saving in XML notebooks that have 
  never been opened (e.g. inside of another notebook).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flip over the remote control for the 
  looks of a picture you see the notebook of sensors for the picture flies out. 
  If the notebook was already on the floor in another house (or on the floor and 
  you are training a robot in a thought bubble) then the notebook did not 
  appear.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to flip over more than 
  one copy of the remote control for the look then the robot sometimes got 
  confused about whether there was one or two notebooks accessible and would 
  sometimes stop. Thanks to Ylva for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes when robots are 
  running on the back of a picture that is flipped over and then flipped again 
  that its size changes to the size it had while flipped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk (or Marty) would 
  describe a team of robots and skip some numbers. (E.g. &quot;the first robot 
  followed by the third robot&quot;). Thanks to Gordon and Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading an untrained robot that 
  had been saved in XML where its thought bubble is in the wrong place.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug triggered by 
  copying a robot that has nothing in his thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you interrupt the 
  replay of a demo and click on &quot;Take Over&quot; that ToonTalk didn't always start up 
  again. Sometimes you needed to minimize and then open it again.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/29</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk would convert a bird to a 
  long-distance bird unnecessarily. E.g. if Bammer smashed something that 
  contained a bird but didn't contain her nest then ToonTalk would freeze the 
  first time in the session while it initializes the network connections.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of the result of 
  loading a picture when ToonTalk can't find the file defining its appearance. 
  Previously it was a text pad but now it is a picture with text on top. XML 
  only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you load a picture with a missing file, you 
  can now save it again it will be saved as it once was not as it currently 
  appears since the file can't be loaded. XML only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now load picture saved in XML where the 
  file defining its appearance has changed dimensions since it was saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you load a picture that had been created 
  with a full path name (e.g. by drag and drop) and the file is missing then 
  ToonTalk would look in the FileSearchPath for a file of the same name. However 
  it only used the value of MissingPictureFileExtension for the extension even 
  if the original path had a different extension. Now ToonTalk checks first for 
  the original extension and failing that uses the default set by 
  MissingPictureFileExtension.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored an optimization that sometimes greatly 
  speeds up flipping through a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed additional problems saving and restoring 
  scales in XML. Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where 
  sometimes the robot's name was not on his chest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes text pads in boxes when changed no 
  longer fit into the hole. Thanks to Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/30</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on&nbsp; 1/17 where 
  ToonTalk might crash or act odd when replaying a demo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 1/26 where when 
  flipping through a notebook when blank pages are reached ToonTalk displayed 
  the contents of the previous pages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug saving a 
  notebook in the main notebook in XML. Thanks to Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when training a robot with a sensor 
  for the looks of a picture, the robot would be trained with a copy of the 
  picture and sometimes with a sensor for the looks. Now it always is a picture. 
  Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when training a robot with the remote 
  looks of a picture that has been flipped the robot was trained with the wrong 
  side of the picture. Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When training a robot with the remote looks of 
  a picture that has other pictures on top those pictures were lost during 
  training.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sometimes saving in XML a city 
  where a sensor of the parts of a picture was in use. Thanks to Yishay for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released version 2.75</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem triggered by the clipboard 
  having text with a ; that is not followed by a space. (Caused problems parsing 
  to see if text pad is a sequence of numeric operations.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem loading 
  notebooks with notebooks inside.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of things removed 
  from the back of a remote control for the looks of something. Undid this fixed 
  on 2/12 since applied too widely and caused text pads to change size after 
  being pumped up or down.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem that made 
  it hard to vacuum out the box in a robot's thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now exits (rather than crash) if the 
  DLL with the language-specific strings is missing. As before a dialog box 
  reports the problem first.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/7</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems caused by boxes with more than 
  32K holes. Some display and selection problems remain to be fixed. Boxes can 
  now have as many holes as memory permits with a limit of 2^31-1.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Boxes with more than 64K holes can be saved in 
  XML. If <a href="ttini.htm#SaveInXML">SaveInXML</a>=0 then boxes will be saved 
  as if they had at most 64K holes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that occurred sometimes loading 
  a city with running robots.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading cities saved in XML 
  where Bammer the Mouse is running out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading cities saved in XML 
  where robots were running and you were standing in the room.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/8</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading a city saved in XML 
  when a robot had been trained with a box that was subsequently destroyed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving a city in XML when a 
  house was created by a truck crew and then the robot in the truck was 
  destroyed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem caused sometimes by vacuuming 
  up a flipped picture and its notebook of remote controls.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Removed a spurious warning caused when a bird 
  is flying to her nest and the nest is not in a room (e.g. is in a truck that 
  is driving).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem when a bird flies from the 
  floor to another house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where 
  sometimes items on the page of a notebook were the wrong size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the placement of items on notebook 
  pages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a picture and its remote 
  control were both flipped over and then the notebooks vacuumed up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced memory leak of the 
  things on a floor when a house is blown up by a robot (out of sight).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sometimes caused when
  <a href="ttini.htm#MaximumItemsInDusty">MaximumItemsInDusty</a> had been set.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some recently introduced rare problems 
  copying things.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem when a text pad is bammed 
  with another off screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem copying a robot when the 
  contents of its thought bubble was connected with other items (e.g. bird/nest 
  or sensor/picture) outside of the thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the toontalk.ini switch
  <a href="ttini.htm#MinimumTimeSample">MinimumTimeSample</a>. This controls how 
  accurate the millisecond timer is. The default value is 1. If, for example, it 
  is set to 10 then the timer has 10 millisecond accuracy. On a few systems this 
  may speed up ToonTalk. If set to 0 or a negative value, leaves the system 
  default set by Microsoft Windows. Note that you should set this to 0 to run on 
  an Apple Macintosh running VirtualPC. (Default was incorrectly set until 
  2/14.)</font></li>
</ol>

  when a bird has temporarily removed the stack of things on her nest to put a 
  new item on the bottom.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when a bird is flying to her 
  nest and the nest is in a truck that is driving off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a bird would fly from the 
  floor in the wrong direction to deliver something to another house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the notebook of the
  <a href="ttini.htm#DefaultUser">DefaultUser</a> wasn't reconstructed correctly 
  if it had been saved in XML.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem saving 
  teams of more than 2 robots in XML where they didn't know about each other. 
  Dropping the team corrected the problem.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/13</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem caused by loading a city 
  where objects were animating in certain ways.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the range of the random 
  number sensor was 0 to 1000 inclusive immediately after it was copied. It now 
  is always 0 to 999.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added the command line alternative
  <a href="command.htm#DefaultUser">-default_user</a> to the toontalk.ini
  <a href="ttini.htm#DefaultUser">DefaultUser</a> option. This way an icon can 
  have a different default user than the other icons.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/21</font></p>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.81</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/15</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug saving a foreign bird in XML if 
  there was a problem recreating the bird. E.g. a foreign bird to a file might 
  fail to load if the file already exists. Thanks to Yishay for providing 
  examples of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that caused notebooks to 
  sometimes be saved in XML with empty pages.</font></li>

  this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/24</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you pause ToonTalk while holding something 
  there are now many new options. You can save it to a file (with or without 
  associated picture and sounds), create a Java applet, or edit it as a picture. 
  Also when saving a city you can choose to save it with media or not.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now generates snapshots when saving 
  something or generating a Java applet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk generates an applet it now 
  automatically generates the needed GIF or AU files from user pictures or WAV 
  files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="ttini.htm#PictureEditor">PictureEditor</a> 
  and <a href="ttini.htm#RunAfterSaving">RunAfterSaving</a> are new toontalk.ini 
  options.</font></li>

  parts are now displayed correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.83.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/25</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping a remote looks of a text pad on 
  something that expected a text pad didn't work right if the original text pad 
  was flipped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If using the new scheme that maintains a 
  private directory of media then imported sounds have the short file name not 
  the full path.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something goes wrong while generating a 
  snapshot then ToonTalk no longer crashes - just the file isn't created.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of missing files when 
  using the new media scheme.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/29</font></p>
<ol>

  arithmetical operations.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the internal workings of the new 
  ability to take snapshots of what is in your hand.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where sometimes the remote control 
  for a picture's container was associated with the wrong picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made ToonTalk more robust when dealing with 
  missing picture files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sped up the load of XML by several factors but 
  introduced bugs with some text pads and file names. (Fixed on 4/7)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/7</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a crash while 
  quitting ToonTalk while birds are flying around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems dealing with missing image 
  files that lead to crashes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed recently introduced bug with text pads 
  and file names when loading XML.</font></li>

  saved in XML is loaded so that copies of that nest aren't found by the bird.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes sensors left on 
  the floor in a saved city didn't work right when restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored a feature that has been broken since 
  ToonTalk began supporting fractions and large numbers. You can once again drop 
  operations on read-only sensors (like the random number generator) and those

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem replaying DMO logs when certain 
  notebooks are used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes notebooks were restored with pages 
  inactive even though the page contents were active when dropped on the 
  notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where user pictures didn't copy 
  correctly when the new media directory is enabled. The file name was lost and 
  black was replaced by near black so that the SEE SOME setting of the 
  visibility sensor had no effect.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk crashed if you tried 
  to generate a Java applet of something containing pictures whose image files 
  couldn't be found.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copies of pictures created with version 2.83 
  through 2.87 caused ToonTalk crashes - they are now repaired as best as 
  possible by turning them into colored rectangles. The image file name has been 
  lost so not much more can be done.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copies of the random number generator now 
  typically display different numbers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a house was blown up with a 
  notebook of remote controls for a picture on the floor then ToonTalk crashed 
  when Dusty spits things out or became &quot;full&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a truck was driving into a house while you 
  fly from a side view to a view from above then the robots weren't placed in 
  the house. Bug was introduced 12/26/02.</font></li>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you visited a city saved in XML then your 
  language setting was reset to that the city had when it was saved. No longer 
  changes the language.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The way XML was put into zip archives did not 
  restore correctly non-ASCII characters such as those in Sweden and Portuguese. 
  Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you made a Java applet twice in the same 
  session and your program included a notebook then ToonTalk crashed. Thanks to 
  Ylva for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk's random number generator was not very 
  random. In particular every other number was odd and even. Thanks to Gordon 
  for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.89</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/14</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that prevented the wiggling 
  feedback from occurring sometimes when holding something over a number or text 
  pad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made improvements to how ToonTalk handles user 
  pictures (though introduced a bug fixed on 4/28 that caused copying of user 
  pictures to appear to lose transparency). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem caused when something has been 
  copied by the Magic Wand using O (for original) and then the object is flipped 
  while still attached to the wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.90</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/17</font></p>

  travel.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/28</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird and nest are in a vacuum and the city 
  is saved the bird is converted to a long-distance bird unnecessarily thereby 
  wasting resources and time. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem retraining a robot that drops 
  something on an erased box. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In various situations robots were doing 
  significantly more work than necessary when off screen. And if they were 
  running on the back of a picture then when the picture was flipped over the 
  size and location of items was sometimes distorted. Thanks to Gordon for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 4/14 related to 
  transparency of copies of user pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Scales now totter even if they are on a nest.</font></li>

  narrow they disappear. Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if you are holding a text or 
  number pad or a synthetic picture (e.g. a rectangle) and select the new 'Edit 
  Picture' option where ToonTalk stopped until you minimized and then maximized 
  it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.91</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/29</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk once again gives feedback (a white 
  rectangle) when an invisible object is selected or held. Thanks to Leonel for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot terminates abnormally the team 
  didn't always re-form correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copy a file in the Windows Explorer 
  (with control-c or by selecting copy from the right-click menu) then you now 
  can paste it into ToonTalk even if the file is a picture or sound. Previously 
  only worked for files containing ToonTalk clippings or text files. Thanks to 
  Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.92</font></li>

  other members of a team of robots when one of the team finishes.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Flipped pictures left on the 
  floor when a city is saved were not always restored with the right geometry.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pressing the Alt key (or

<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now support

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where 
  sometimes Java applets were confused when matching scales.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of 
  Java toontalk.ini options specifying the ttclass zip and cab files. Also if 
  these ttclass files are updated then directories using copies of them are
