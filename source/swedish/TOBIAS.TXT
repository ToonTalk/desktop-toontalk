Hi,

I'm trying to learn more about how to program in ToonTalk. I wanted to
make a picture move when you push the arrow buttons. I programmed two
rebots, one for the up arrow and one for the down arrow. If you press
the down arrow the picture should move 5 pixels down.
  When I programmed the robots I used the remote control for "reseltly
pressed key". It worked quite fine, but the picture only moved one time
a keypress. I can understand that since the remote control only shows
the key for a very short period. And therefor the robot only does what
he is programmed to one time.

I could use the "last pressed key" instead, but then the picture would
move all the time, right? How can I make thins work? What I want is to
make the picture move when I hold the key down, 5 pixels a time.

I also made a program that should make new houses when I set a switch to
on, but when I set the switch to on I got an errormessage wanting me to
close ToonTalk. I used a robot that started when the frame was 1 (on).
The robot sent away another preprogrammed robot in a truck to do noting
in a new house except for getting there with a counter (house no.).
Maybe you'd need a better explenation to figure out what happened. As a
matter of I tried to make a logfile of it (.dmo), but I never got one.
Perhaps ToonTalk couldn't generate one when the error occured.

I konw it's already on it's way (the CD), but I think the picture on
page 26 (a helicopter) should be named "Helikopter" instead of "landar"
(which means landing). I also think that the picture on page 60 (a
rocket) should be named "Raket" not "Racket" wich means paddle (probably
our fault).

That's all for this time. Oh, congratulation for your success.

Tobias
