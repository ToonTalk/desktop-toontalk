   This is the result of "pasting" a ToonTalk object. You can include
this in files, email, or whatever. To decode it just use any program
that can copy this to Window's clipboard. For example, you can use
Window's notepad or write program. Just be sure your selection includes
the code below and then select the Copy command in the Edit menu.
Then it will appear in the ToonTalk remote control for the clipboard.
Just use Dusty to vacuum it off the clipboard.
   The following is a picture of a ball.  The  first thing on the back is a
box with 2 holes whose hole labeled with "Key" contains a remote control
for the key just pressed and whose hole labeled with "Up" contains a
remote control for the distance from the bottom side.  The  second thing
on the back is a robot who wants a box with 2 holes whose hole labeled
with "Key" contains a pad with the text "Up arrow" on it and whose hole
labeled with "Up" contains any number (for example, a remote control for
the distance from the bottom side). If given a box like that he will
move to the stack of numbers.  And pick up a number.  And push the '5'
key to change what he is holding.  And drop it on the second hole of the
box he's working on.  .
   What follows is in a special code and was produced by ToonTalk(tm) 
Beta Version 5A.
