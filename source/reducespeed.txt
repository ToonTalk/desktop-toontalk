   This is the result of "pasting" a ToonTalk object. You can include
this in files, email, or whatever. To decode it just use any program
that can copy this to Window's clipboard. For example, you can use
Window's Notepad or Write program. Just be sure your selection includes
the code below and then select the Copy command in the Edit menu. 
Then it will appear in the ToonTalk remote control for the clipboard. 
You can find the clipboard remote control on page 30 of the Sensor notebook. 
Just use Dusty to vacuum it off the clipboard. 
   The following is a box with 2 holes. The first hole contains a hollow
oval which is partly visible. The first thing on the back is a box with
3 holes. The hole labeled with "message" contains an empty nest. The
hole labeled with "Up Speed" contains a remote control for the speed
towards the top. The hole labeled with "inc" contains the number -10.
And the second thing on the back is a robot who wants a box with 3
holes. The first hole contains a pad with the text "hit" on it. The hole
labeled with "Up Speed" contains any number (for example, a remote
control for the speed towards the top). The hole labeled with "inc"
contains any number. If given a box like that he will pick up his box.
And drop it. And grab a magic wand. And use the magic wand on the third
hole inside his box. And drop what he just copied on the second hole
inside his box. And release the magic wand. And grab a copy of Dusty.
And use Dusty to vacuum what's in the first hole inside his box. And
release Dusty. The second hole contains a bird.
