stack).
-- Cubby stack no longer accepts stuff (too easy to do by mistake)
-- Can now use item attached to magic wand and can also toss it by releasing
it while holding down control

-- Fixed a bug when a robot is trained to pick up and drop a team of robots
into a truck
5/25
-- If a robot was trained to drop a nest in a hole and then grasp the 
hatched bird, it sometimes would try to grab the bird before it hatched
and get confused.
6/1
-- Recently made sure that robots would stop working when inside a vacuum
but this caused a bug when robot was running in an exploding house
-- Sometimes when a robot aborted it left the cubby it was working on
in a state that other robots would not accept it.  Fixed now.
-- Fixed recently introduced bug that crashed when flipping a picture
-- When a flipped picture is vacuum, its quickly flips first and its notebook
comes along
6/2
-- Changed the internal structure so that items always know what background
they are part of
-- To avoid confusion, dropping a picture on a notebook no longer tries to 
find the page with that picture.
-- If a robot drops a number or text on a notebook to go to a page, is only
seen if robot is on screen
6/5

items to the background on 6/2
-- If you got up while a robot (or truck) was waiting for a bird to create
a nest, the system crashed.
6/6

if standing up during it)
-- Robots wrongly took out a nest rather than the top of the stack of stuff
on top
6/7

they get out of the ToolBox
-- Changed the way colors for rectangles are computed.
6/10
-- If a notebook was taken out of a notebook and then more was added to
the original notebook, it crashed.
-- Thought bubble did not animate the receipt of a box.
-- If a box taken out of a notebook contained a bird or nest and was given
to a robot without a thought, then we used to enter the robot's thought bubble
before it was ready.
[disabled last 2 since it destabilized the system and demos are coming up]
-- If a bird builds a nest and doesn't have a cubby to return it flew off.
(Happens if you say copy a bird out of a thought bubble.)
6/12
-- Fixed newly introduced bugs when connecting a thought bubble to a robot.
-- Sometimes when a bird released something in its nest it went under the
cubby the nest was in and then popped up in the nest.

of a picture
-- Saving a blank remote control in a notebook could not be re-read correctly.
-- Fixed newly introduced pauses in helicopter sound (looping sounds in general)

to crash sometimes).
6/21
-- Martian used to warn if a remote control notebook was dropped on another
notebook even if it wasn't on a blank page
-- Martian would crash trying to describe a remote control whose object
was destroyed.
-- Nothing special happens if something is dropped on a stack since this
happens too often accidentically and the result can be confusing.  -z 1
turns this feature back on.
-- Robots used to jump to the lower left while being vacuumed.
6/22
-- Robots on the flip side of a picture no longer look like they are waiting
when a box is dropped on them.
-- Copying with a wand a nest without a bird crashed the system.
-- Nests without birds with just one thing on top now copy as the thing on top.
-- Birds check that the box it is given doesn't contain its nest now works
even if a nest in that box contains the nest.
-- The system no longer uses the stack to run a robot.  Therefore there should
no longer be a limit to how many actions a trained robot can perform

-- System sometimes crashed when copying a box with a bird and its nest in it.
-- Sometimes the copy of a nest got its egg back.
-- If while training a robot, it picks up a nest then when running it will pick
up the entire nest even if there is stuff on it.  Normally robots just take
the top of the stack.  They now wait if the stack is empty in these cases.
-- A nest in a thought bubble now matches a nest even if there is stuff on top.
-- Occassionally toolbox got caught in an explosion -- think that's fixed now.
-- If a robot in training dropped a box on the stack of robots, Martian warned
about how you can't have a robot train a robot.
6/24
-- Martian when called via F1 used to say old stuff before continuing with
help.

to be filled.
-- Robots had troubles dropping something on a nest in a box.  (Recently
introduced bug.)
-- Geometry of stack of stuff on a nest broken when nest was on a nest in a
box.
-- Blanked 0 hole boxes looked wrong.
-- Redesigned the way ToonTalk decides what size to make item held or dropped
on the floor.  Pictures act as they did before but everything else has its
own idea of what a good size is.  Faster and less memory per object but if you
drop something in a box and then take it out, for example, it will have lost
its original size.
6/27
-- Bike pump now only works on the item selected when the mouse button went down.
To switch to another item the mouse must be released and pushed again.
-- Fixed various problems with the geometry of 0-hole boxes.

-- Selection feedback is now 10 movements per second max since looked bad
on Pentiums
-- Martian doesn't interrupt himself as much and waits a bit before changing
topics.
7/13
-- Replaying a log is now more robust (if mouse moved very much was recorded
wrong and way that frame number was handled when nothing changed were problems).
-- Fixed timing bug in -I feature (replay with original timing).
7/15
-- Fixed geometry bug in appearance remote control and visibility remote
control.
-- Pictures of numbers and things can now be pumped by bike pump.

a stack in the toolbox then system crashed.
8/1
-- System would crash if Martian tried to describe a robot that was waiting
for a bird to cover a nest.
-- Rarely the system would crash while standing up.  Fixed.
8/2
-- Changed the way random numbers are generated to make replay more reliable.
-- Martian would try to beam in when outside and only its thought bubble appeared.
Doesn't try now.
-- Martian said "a robot in stopped" rather than "a robot somewhere stopped".
-- If while a truck was driving off, its robots or cubby was grabbed system
crashed.
-- Can once again return a nest to the stack (if the bird hasn't hatched).
-- Tweaked when things appear in tool box.
8/3
-- Birds whose nest is in a vacuum (or has no nest) used to cause Martian to
appear and explain things even when a tool was dropped on the bird.  Now only
explains things if a rectangular item is given to such a bird.
-- When a bird put an item under the stack of stuff on its nest the stack
was floating (higher than your hand).
-- -i now creates a log that stores all the parameters (programmer appearance,
number of mouse buttons, etc) in the log.  Also -i and -o now add the extension
.TTT (ToonTalk Trace) to the file name.  A trace file name is ok as the only
thing on the command line.
-- -m <percent> still defines the percentage of the default amount of memory
that might be devoted to a performance cache.  The default amount is now 25%
of available memory.  (E.g. -m 200 means use 50%.)
-- Sometimes a sound was skipped.
8/4
-- Used to be you could pass thru the front of a landed helicopter and it was hard
to get back in.
8/8
-- Changed .TTT files to .DMO and implemented .SPK files which provide narration
for DMO files.
-- The bike pumb sometimes shrank stuff off to the edge of the screen.
-- Performance bug that flushed the screen cache when an item is given a
new level when it already is the highest.
-- Sprites scaled by alot (e.g. x10) sometimes crashed.
-- If multi-line text was large sometimes things that should be seen under
it disappeared.
8/9

ghosts behind for a while.
-- Martian when giving directed help about Dustee repeated some stuff and
explained things poorly.
-- First time Martian is called in to give directed help, he sometimes talked
about other stuff.
-- Fixed SPK narration bugs.
-- Notebooks still accept numbers or text dropped on them to jump to a matching
page but not if they are screen size or bigger.
-- Improved the geometry of shrinking things with bike pump.
-- Martian if sent away (via F1) while saying something important wouldn't
talk again until something that important came along.
-- After replaying log tried unsucessfully to restore command line options.
Don't try now.
8/11
-- Typing escape while running a demo while quit the demo now.

is filled with random houses.
-- Sometimes (especially on a fast machine) when using the magic wand the arm
moves high off the screen.
-- Martian would sometimes skip to the next topic when giving directed help about
what is in his hand.
8/12
-- Martian would interrupt himself too much.
-- Text in talk balloon now fits much better.
-- If in -b 1 mode, a tool was used with shift down then releasing shift
while still holding the mouse released the tool.
-- Reduced use of stack (recursion) in scheduler.
8/13
-- Fixed narration bug that over-wrote memory after last narration.
-- Bug in code to add to log a record of an action that stopped.
-- While replaying a log the system no longer resets the computer's 
mouse position nor hides it.  Yet to be implemented is a way of running
ToonTalk (not in replay) and still use other Windows programs.  Can switch
with "pause" but may want it to keep running.
-- When robots are running offscreen and both -i and -o switches are used
the system would sometimes loop.
-- Fixed a minor memory leak in handling user input.
-- The "camera" view when leaving a house varied unpredictably.

8/18
-- Remote control for looks did not update properly if thing it was
controlling was in another house.
-- Martian would repeatedly explain that some things can't be dropped
on a picture.  Only says it once now.
-- Changed the way color indices are computed.  Default color is now
black (e.g. for remote control for looks where controlee is missing).
-- Remote controls for Lego sensors when in thought bubble do not
become blank like most remote controls do.
-- Robots on back of picture would sometimes stop (due to mismatch) but
then wouldn't start again if the thing being matched was a remote control
(and therefore changes on its own).
-- System would crash if while a robot was running on the back of a picture
the picture was destroyed (e.g. smashed by mouse's hammer).
-- Fixed label for Lego sensor count.
-- If a robot is running on the back of a picture, then the scheduler treats
it like a remote control -- i.e. runs only once per frame and is retried
on every frame.
-- Enabled Martian to describe the new Lego controller remote controls.
-- Renamed the characters from Martee to Marty, etc..
8/21
-- Changed the internal format of .SPK and .DMO files.

and its tools coming out take zero time when entering a thought bubble.
Fix for it breaks DMO files so not installed yet.

fully.
-- Fixed problem training a robot to pick up the cubby it is working on
and type a number to change its size.
-- Fixed a problem where a robot changes the number of holes of a cubby
and the screen refresh becomes bad.
8/25
-- Fixed a bug that can crash the system when a nest is destroyed before
all of its birds.
-- Sometimes when a nest contains a nest (possibly etc) then robots get
confused.
9/1

movie loops to pictures.
-- Fixed bug where only sometimes when entering a thought bubble was the
opening of the tool box and departure of the tools animated.
9/16
-- Blowing up a house while a mouse was in action sometimes caught the
mouse in the vacuum and when spit out crashed the system.
9/18
-- If vacuum used while vacuuming a team of robots the system crashed.
9/20
-- Bird can no longer be given a picture which on the back contains the bird's
nest.  Martian explains why.  Also the occur check is much faster now.
-- Fixed a display bug where sometimes stuff removed from nest was displayed
in the nest for a while.
9/21
-- If a robot was trained to give a bird something, and then was given
something where the bird wasn't there it used to crash.  Now the Martian
warns you and it continues if it can.
9/22
-- Improved geometry of bird building a nest and bird hatching from nest.
Including when they are on the flipside of a picture.
-- Fixed bug in giving a bird something when that bird's nest has been destroyed.
9/25
-- Martian would sometimes appear while user was standing but then not say
anything until he or she sat down.
-- Now when you drop a robot on the back on the picture it ignores what is
underneath (used to be if it was a robot it made a team).
-- Implemented -q <speed>.  If speed is less than 100 slows down the system
and if over 100 speeds it up.
-- Implemented -y <delay>.  Sleeps delay milliseconds on every frame.
-- Changed the way the walking programmer makes sounds so sound should only
happen when taking a step.

-- Changed the meaning of -1 to mean read-only access to notebooks of -n <name>
(And still no updating of user profile.)
-- Sometimes an operation was added to a remote twice.

whether if a text or number pad if it is an indication of the page number.
-- Fixed major display bug with boxes with large number of holes.
-- Adjusted the levels of the robot, the programmers arm and stuff being
held so that fewer impossible things are displayed (e.g. robot is under a
box being held by programmer but uses it wand on top...)
-- If Toolbox was vacuumed up and then spit out it confused robots so they
couldn't find the stacks in the toolbox.
-- Robots now look like they are waiting when entering room where they are
began waiting while not being watched.
10/3
-- Redesigned file format for blank numbers and remote controls with operations.
-- Blank numbers should now restore to what it was trained for even if they
were remote controls.
-- Fixed various bugs with using and saving blank boxes.
-- Robots and ToonTalk could become very confused if the programmer grabbed
something out of the hand of a robot.  No longer possible.
-- Remote controls now consistently apply to the picture they are on the back
of regardless of where they came from.  They are restored to their original
state when removed from the back of a picture.  
-- If an offscreen nest received a number that was created offscreen then
it showed up as 1 until picked up or dropped.
10/4
-- Fixed recently introduced bugs with blank cubbies.
-- Dropping a number or text on blank cubbies crashed system if cubby has
undo information for restoring its original state.
-- Fixed priority level for nests with stacks inside boxes.   Used to be
sometimes the contents of a box would float if a covered nest was there.
-- Made the system's ability to read in old user files and update them much
more reliable.
-- Improved the animation of robots when they use a vacuum or magic wand.
-- Changed the meaning of -y <n> to make the minimum duration of a frame be
n.  Good for slowing down a machine is smooth manner.
-- Fixed display bug of a label of a box that sometimes included "junk".
10/5
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug when a robot blows up house while being
watched.

-- Fixed a palette problem when Windows running with more than 256 colors.
-- Fixed a problem in full screen mode where the frame around the screen
blinked on and off.

thrice 320x240
-- Sizing the windows ToonTalk is running in to close to the whole screen 
make it run in the whole screen (but not using the DISPDIB -f 1 whole screen
mode)
-- Implemented -e <font name>.  For names with space use _.
10/7
-- Fixed more memory leaks and bug caught by Code Guard (which didn't 
manifest themselves on Win 95 or Win 3.1).
-- Was the case that if a nest with one thing on top was copied and its
bird has been destroyed then it copied just the thing on top.  This is
not consistent with the general behavior of copying and no longer behaves
this way.
10/8
-- Fixed a geometry bug with nests and birds in cubbies inside of other things.
-- Fixed a geometry bug that caused long cubbies held by a robot to slowly
increase (due to round off error)
-- Fixed a memory leak for remote control notebooks.
10/9
-- Mouse no longer runs on top of programmer's arm and hand but underneath
(unless programmer is holding target since it has to reach it)
-- When a picture is flipped the notebook no longer flies out of view.
-- A robot can now be trained to take its working cubby and add it to another
cubby (left, right or inside).

-- Robots used to hang if the label was rubbed out when empty.
10/11
-- If something containing something that is changing (e.g. a remote control
inside a box) and the changing item was obscured (but not the container too)
then the container would sometimes become invisible.
-- When robots were working off screen sometimes they would drop things
off to the side so when sitting they couldn't be seen.
-- Sometimes when a robot was running off screen and stopped with a number
the digits of the number were very narrow.
-- Houses that were being built while the helicopter is landing did not
finish and so the robots inside never got to start (until you fly over
those houses or walked over to that block).
10/12
-- Dropping a cubby on a zero-hole cubby crashed the system.

-- Fixed two recently introduced bugs with Martain describing the flipside
of a picture.
10/17
-- Fixed a clipping bug so that stuff on the back of a picture (or a picture
on a picture) stuck out 1 or 2 pixels too far.

the system afterwards.
-- Disabled optimization that made pictures tend to float.  Looked bad
and was confusing.
-- Fixed bugs when a robot in training flips a picture or number over.

(And another multiple nest bug.)
-- Improved the geometry of nests in cubbies.
-- Sometimes the edge of a selected object was visible above things on top
of it.
-- Improved collision detection and uncollision.
-- If a cubby with a scale was removed from a thought bubble and returned

and comes back to the cubby.  The robot now starts working when the bird
returns.
12/12
-- Added sensors for mouse button events.
12/13
-- Added sensor for last key stroke.

-- Remote controls with text appearance now work better
-- Added remote controls for visibility of the programmer's hand and sound.
-- If ToonTalk is started with just one arg (e.g. toontalk Ken) then it now
assumes it is the user's name if a log file (DMO) of that name doesn't exist.
12/18
-- Added a new notebook called "Options" to the main notebook.  This contains
8 different remote controls for system parameters (e.g. sound on or off,
size of the city and so on).  These are saved in such a way that if the same
user starts up ToonTalk the previous values of these options is the default 
which can be over-ridden by the command line.
-- Fixed a bug in reseting the cache (happens when memory gets low).
12/19
-- Added several more options to new notebook.

demo selection, etc.  Welcome is designed for Win95 autoplay feature.
12/28
-- ToonTalk now remembers the last user's name and uses that as a default.
-- ToonTalk is now much more CDROM capable where if files are missing it
will read (and possibly temporarily copy) files from the CDROM.
-- On some machines the ToonTalk fonts looked wierd.  They are now better
specified.

new houses.
-- Fixed problem is Martain description of right mouse button with shortcuts
turned off.
-- Robots got confused if you trained them to take out a nest, put stuff in
the nest and then took it out again.
-- Was the case that if while training a robot to hatch a bird, that if after 
dropping the nest one picked something up before the bird hatched the robot
got confused.
-- Martian now describes robots who pick up what is on top of a nest better.
-- Rapid mouse clicks while holding the magic wand sometimes lead to the
copy becoming stuck to the wand.
1/10
-- If you train a robot to give a bird something and its nest is available
in the thought bubble the bird will deliver it now.  Previously the bird just
flew off with it and returned empty handed.
-- ToonTalk now consistently creates and reads files from MainDir defined
in \windows\toontalk.ini
-- If running in full screen mode it used to be that message boxes would
hang the system -- now it switches modes first.
-- ToonTalk no longer needs files toontalk.pal, toontalk.rem, toontalk.bok,
toontalk.2, etc.
1/11

top of the screen
-- Martian would jump back and forth rapidly if holding magic wand near bottom
of screen.
-- Martian would give spurious advice if dropping a tool on top of a text pad.
-- Trucks would still miss a part of the city sometimes.

giving you options of quiting, continuing or minimizing.
-- If you copy the vacuum and then vacuum up tools and then set up a bomb
the system crashed.

a bird.
1/13

high values without a crash.
-- Repeated appearances (over 64) of Martian could sometimes crash system.
-- Martian now gives advice first time you train a robot to put its box in
a truck.
-- A robot who drops a scale on a scale now stops.

dropped on it).
-- Improved various things in the startTT application and the autoplay clickme
application.
-- Fixed problems with TooonTalk's use of toontalk.ini (and it would crash
if it was missing).
-- Fixed problem copying DAT files from CDROM.
1/16

old size even if pretty small.
-- Sometimes when two boxes were put together some components weren't displayed
for a while.
-- Fixed problem with recording a power on/off (F8) in logs for replay.
1/18
-- Added a "Switches" section to toontalk.ini and GenerateLogs entry which
if non-zero means that a log DMO file will be kept named log<n>.dmo where
n ranges from 0 to the value of GenerateLogs.
Just a quick way to capture user logs (-o <fileName>
produces the same kind of logs).
-- Fixed several bugs which occur when training a robot and quickly drop
more than one thing on something which brings out the mouse.  In particular,
if a number is dropped on a number which a mouse is going to smash.
-- Fixed a bug where robots got confused if trained on box with an empty hole
that it fills and empties and then is run with that hole filed beforehand.
[This unfortunately may break some stored robots.]

to complete.
1/19
-- Fixed recently introduced bugs where robots lost track of stuff they
set down.
-- System could crash if you picked up a robot while it was vacuuming.
-- Scheduler now treats the random number generator differently.  Sensors
that can only change once per cycle (frame) when matched by a robot's thought
bubble mean that the robot only runs once per cycle.
-- Sometimes vacuuming up tool box and spitting him out made the toolbox
look empty when it isn't.
-- Fixed many bugs with putting flipped pictures on the back of flipped pictures
to transfer their behavior.
-- Used to be if you dropped Dusty while he was sucking up (or spitting out)
that he didn't morph to inert.
-- Improved the way ToonTalk decides where something is being dropped when
there are more than one things under it.
-- If you call quickly (twice) for another tool while holding the magic wand 
it now works fine.
1/21
-- Improved the criteria used to decide whether a robot should be allowed to
run more than once per cycle.  It now depends upon whether a remote control
that is updated only once per cycle is either matched, compared (via scales),
or used in a computation.  Just picking up and rearranging such remotes has
no effect now.
-- Added a remote control and sensor for interfacing with Window's clipboard.
1/22
-- Can not add tools (Dusty, etc) to clipboard.
-- Can not flip over remote sensors or controls (including clipboard one).

of a picture becomes very tiny.
1/23
-- Changed many expressions Martian uses to hopefully be clearer.

-- Fixed recently introduced problems with putting things on top of boxes that
don't belong (e.g. robots or trucks).
1/24
-- Dropping things on a clipboard remote that is "full" didn't activate them
(e.g. if a picture with robots on the back).
-- Can now drop your notebook (or a copy of it) on the clipboard and any
file references internally are resolved so the recipient needs no such files.
-- Removed restriction about placing notebooks in notebooks.
-- Provided support for automatically updating user notebooks from version 3 to 4.
-- Fixed problem running Ping Pong Act 3 demo in finding the right notebook.

resolution mode 640x480.
-- If system needed to put up a message box (e.g. that something was missing
but should be on CDROM so please insert CDROM) then it put up the "pause"
dialog first.
1/29
-- Fixed some recently introduced initialization problems.
-- Switched over to a newer library for doing full screen mode.  Should
be more robust.

does not exist.
-- Fixed a new problem with full screen mode showing the mouse cursor.
-- Start ToonTalk only once reminds you that if you are running off
the CDROM it may be slow.
2/2
-- Can now pass command line arguments to StartTT.EXE in exactly the same way
as ToonTalk.EXE.
-- Dialog asking your name is now system modal.  Can't do anything until
you respond to it.  Fixed problems with focus and getting buried.
-- If you used the option to change your head (bald, hat or long hair) then
it would sometimes introduce a severe performance bug.
-- A few remote controls with a small set of possible values (programmer's head,
picture's visibility, and screen size) would go black if sufficient '-'s were
typed.
-- Backspace now moves back a page of a notebook.  Like "-" if at page 1
it goes to the end of the notebook.

running a demo.
-- Now if a Start ToonTalk is running -- starting another will activate
the one that is already running.
-- Fixed a problem were a little slice of the Martian's talk balloon is
sometimes left behind.
-- Fixed a bug where replaying didn't always work when a robot blew up a house
the programmer was in.

-- Fixed a bug where if notebooks were added to the main notebook and the
connected directory is different from the ToonTalk directory the result was
lost.
-- If you removed a box with a scale from a though bubble, used the vacuum
to blank some items and then returned it the scale kept tetering.  Now it
shows the relationship between the original items (does this only in the
thougth bubble).
-- Fixed a memory leak in collision detector (used in Ping Pong demo).
-- Fixed another minor memory leak.
-- Trucks now accept street and avenue addresses as well as a picture showing
what style of house that should be built.  They must be given before there
is both a box and robot in the truck.
2/6
-- When flying over a city with houses being built and destroyed sometimes
activity would stop if the helicopter wasn't moving.
-- Fixed various bugs in how the Martian described blank items both in and
out of the thought bubbles.
-- Fixed another scheduling bug that houses built in the lower left corner
waited until you left a house before construction was finished.
-- Fixed a bug in the full screen mode (-f 1) which didn't free a Window's
resource after use so after several runs Windows crashed.
-- As before you can drop text on a notebook and it'll find a matching page.
Now it treats space and return as matching.
-- Martian now describes robot's actions better.
-- Martian now describes address.
-- Trucks now search around for a free lot beginning directly north and
going around from there.
-- Fixed a bug that prevented associating ToonTalk with USR files so one
can click on one's user profile file to start up ToonTalk with your name.
2/7
-- Start ToonTalk after installation gives warnings -- if ignored multiple
warnings would appear.
-- ToonTalk makes sure it has input focus now since sometimes it loses it
on initialization.

if he or she wants to try running with it turned off.
2/8
-- Start ToonTalk also offers help if last demo crashed.
-- Start ToonTalk starts a demo on its own only if "See Demos" has been clicked
(and its been idle for a while).  Also now when it does it says it is picking
one.

-- Change the color palette of backgrounds (rooms, thought bubble, and floor)
so they should no longer use any colors solts reserved by Windows.
2/9
-- If a user name has numbers in it, then these are now kept in generating
the filename for USR, LOG and similar files.   Non alpha numerics are removed.
-- Fixed a bug where a robot was trained to find something in a notebook (e.g.
by dropping a number or text on it) and then used keyboard to find another
page.
-- Robots had problems if an item was placed on the floor, something released
on top, and then used again.  
-- Used to be that robots had a limit of 16 things that they can keep track of.
Now it is 256.
-- Fixed bug where robots trained to put pictures or addresses in trucks
tried to vacuum them up at the end.
-- Fixed a bug where a nest was on the floor of an exploding house but the
bird for that house was elsewhere.  When the bird is destroyed the system
crashed.
2/10
-- Fixed a bug where a robot sometimes lost track of things when running
offscreen but not when seen.
2/12
-- Fixed various problems when robots make complex use of notebooks 
(i.e. both drop things on it and use the keyboard to select pages).
-- Fixed a divide by zero problem.
-- If a robot is trained to pick up and release the main notebook, it forgets
it since the notebook is shared with programmer and other robots.
2/13
-- Changed the scheduler when flying outside to let everything progress equally
even if offscreen.
-- Used to be you could sometimes make a copy of a thought bubble without
a robot and then using it could crash the system.
2/20
-- If you trained a robot to pick up a nest and put it back on the stack of nests
then the robot got confused.
2/21
-- Unable to reproduce crash when Martian was talking about something, then
programmer went outside, some part of thing being talked about was destroyed,
and then programmer went into another house.  May have fixed it by reseting
Martian when he teleports out.
2/22

-- Fixed a problem where trucks sometimes drove off into the water.
-- Fixed a problem where when city fills up and one tries to land system crashes.
-- Robots now set notebook to page 1 since that's how they were trained.
3/1
-- Start ToonTalk after showing a demo would sometimes quickly start another
demo rather than waiting 30 seconds for the user to pick one.
-- Fixed a problem where selection feedback of an item with another item
partially obscuring it was sometimes displayed wrong.
-- Improved the geometry of trucks driving around outside.
3/3
-- ToonTalk now disables screen savers when running a demo.
-- If ToonTalk has been partially uninstalled (e.g. the toontalk directory deleted)
then the clickme.exe application now offers to install it again.
-- Fixed a problem when birds are flying outside and their nests are being
moved around.
-- Fixed a problem where you couldn't see what birds were carrying while flying
above them.
3/4
-- Fixed a problem when a bird is putting a message under its stack of stuff
on her nest at the same time a robot is removing things from her nest.
-- Fixed a bug where robots are exploding houses and programmer enters
house before truck does.
-- Fixed a bug where programmer enters house and blows it up before truck
drives in.
-- Fixed a bug where if something outside was destroyed other things on the
block would wait to run.
-- Fixed a bug where sometimes robots in other houses would be stopped when
the programmer entered another house with robots working.
-- Fixed a memory leak when quitting ToonTalk with trucks driving around outside.
3/5
-- Fixed a memory leak when more than 16 blocks have things on them.
-- Switched to a new color palette so graphics should look better.
-- Start ToonTalk now uses Microsoft Word Viewer for viewing and printing
instructions.
-- ToonTalk should behave better under low memory conditions now.
-- Robots now stop if they drop something on a notebook and it doesn't 
indicate a page number.
-- Improved how Martian describes what a robot does with notebook pages.
3/6
-- Houses no longer move around while being built.
-- Improved geometry of houses and trucks.
-- Fixed a bug when the main box the robot is working on is joined onto another.
-- Fixed a bug when a robot is trained to return a notebook to a notebook.
-- If a robot drops something on the main notebook and it is not accepted then
it will see if the notebook it came from (or its "ancestors") will accept it
and then get the next item from that notebook.  Makes notebooks act more like
independent modules even if robots were trained to use main notebook.
3/7
-- Can no longer grab bird or what she's carry while flying.  Led to confusion.
-- When flying very high over city birds carrying sometimes become very wide
(but still very short).
-- Fixed a race between a bird and robot both using the same stack on top
of a nest.
3/8
-- Improved geometry of trucks entering house as seen from above.
-- Robots trained to return things to stacks (in toolbox or a notebook) now
do so more efficiently and robustly.
-- Martian's description of a robot's behavior was correct but odd when it
referred to, for example, "25th to last item...".  Doesn't do that now.
-- Programmer can no longer walk past rightmost wall in room and sit in an
impossible manner.
-- Trucks driving into houses now never "drive on top" of the houses.
-- Programmer now looks dizzy after getting out of an exploding house.
-- For one frame when programmer left house the door partially obscure him
or her.
3/10
-- ClickMe had a bug that if the user left the toontalk.ini file on the
windows directory but deleted the toontalk directory that it would repeatedly
ask if you wanted to install ToonTalk.
-- The remote control for serial port to a Lego controller is operational now.
Works with a Hyperbot controller.  (A Lego Control Lab works only partially,
since the code is based only upon public knowledge.)
-- Improved the handling of errors when running off a CDROM (minimal) install
and things go wrong (e.g. not enough disk space).
-- Control-mouse click while holding some text will now send the string
to Microsoft Window's MCI controller.  For example, "play ok.wav"
will play the audio file named "ok.wav" and "play foo.mid" will play
the MIDI file named "foo.mid".  See Microsoft documentation on MCI.
3/11
-- Sometimes a team of robots on the back of a picture was copied (or saved
in notebook) with some of the robots missing.
-- If a robot was trained to use the remote control for which picture of
a sprite with multiple pictures (or cycles) is showing, then it used to
automatically become blank.  Now it must be blank manually since the value
is usually specific.  E.g. robots on the back of a switch that can be on or
off.
-- MCI interface now replaces text with value (if there is one).  Error messages
improved as well.
-- Start ToonTalk sometimes had troubles finding the instructions for building
an exploding brick.  Path fully specified now.
-- Better error messages for Start ToonTalk now.
-- If running of the CDROM (minimal) install, ToonTalk will not delete
temporarily files if Start ToonTalk is running.  Start ToonTalk will delete
them instead.  This way multiple demos can be seen without recreating
temporary files.
-- Scales are no longer "pictures of scales".
-- New color palette used.
-- Fixed problem where knobs visible when flying over the city moved relative
to "camera".
3/12
-- Updated the audio sound effects.
-- Improved the appearance and animation of scales.
3/13
-- Made it so that typing sounds only occur when programmer, robot in
training makes them, or a robot being watched -- not when a robot is working
off screen.
-- Improved various error messages.
-- Birds and trucks now make sounds outside when programmer is on the ground.
-- ClickMe now will now activate an existing ToonTalk or Start ToonTalk
window if one exists instead of running.
-- Fixed recently introduced bug where Start ToonTalk deletes temporary
files (minimal install from CDROM) and yet an instance of ToonTalk exists
using them.
-- ClickMe and Start ToonTalk now should run off the CDROM even on Windows NT
where it couldn't find the files because the path wasn't explicit enough.
-- Improved the error message if trouble printing directions (in Start ToonTalk).
-- A message box now warns you if you are running -f n (other than n = 1)
and windows is not in 256 color mode.
3/14
-- Robot makes a sound when watched and shuts down due to an abnormal condition.
3/15
-- Fixed bugs when robots use notebook.
-- Fixed bug when programmer is both dizzy and spinning.
3/16
-- Fixed a display bug when displaying something in a corner and clipping
in the corner.  Could crash system or add garbage to display.
3/17
-- Fixed a bug where new items weren't seen outside because too many items
were on the screen at once.
-- Fixed another bug with robot's use of notebooks.
-- Raised the maximum number of items on a screen at once from 64 to 128.
-- Fixed yet another bug with robot's use of notebooks.
-- Fixed a bug when a house is blown up with a nest with stuff on top
and its bird is destroyed later.
-- If a robot was trained to drop text on a number, the Martian explained
that can't be done but the robot did it again when running.
-- Sometimes when walking the toolbox appears in front of the house when
it was behind the house with the programmer just before.  Fixed.
-- Sometimes when a button is clicked while walking outside the helicopter
appeared a block south of programmer.  Now it also animates into location.
-- Exiting ToonTalk now closes any MCI devices started by ToonTalk.
3/18
-- When pasting an object one now gets the full description (it used to be
truncated after 6 lines).
3/19
-- Fixed a bug in how Martian describes a robot's interaction with birds.
3/20
-- If Window's resources are low and the user hits pause, it now behaves
better.
-- If installing the version on ToonTalk on the net or if the floppies are
copied to a hard disk before running setup it no longer asks user to enter
disks.
3/21
-- Martian now longer explains the old behavior of the pause button.
-- Many small internal changes to compile under Borland C++ 5.0.
3/24
-- Switched to Borland C++ 5.0 -- many small changes to work right.
3/25
-- Pasting an object from ToonTalk had some non-standard new line (carriage
return) characters.
3/30
-- The font used when Marty is talking (and the opening screen) was
under-specified so on some machines looked very bad.  Now Arial is used
unless overridden by -e <font name>
4/4
-- Fixed a minor bug when user enters a long name with spaces or other
non-alphanumeric characters.
-- Fixed a bug that can lead to a crash when training a robot to use certain
kinds of remote controls ("Which picture?" and the Lego sensors).
-- If something other than a box was placed on top of a robot without
anything in his thought bubble and then a box was dropped on the robot
or thought bubble such that a part of it overlapped with the object on top of
the robot but it mostly was over the robot then confusion followed.
-- If a robot was trained to attach box to the side on another and then when
working tried to add a box to the side of a blank box it crashed.  Now robot
stops and Martian explains problem.
-- Sometimes when Martian was explaining why a robot stopped it would repeat part
of the sentence and skip another part.
-- Scales sometimes would not change to tilt but robots still matched as if
they were showing the right tilt.
4/12
-- Fixed a bug introduced on 4/4 that may cause a memory violation
on start up.
-- Sometimes a robot would get confused and say he didn't expect to
keep track of so many things.  Not anymore.
-- The maximum city size is 255 (or -255 if you want it half filled with
randomly placed houses) but you used to be able to set it to 256 and get
weird results.
-- Marty now explains city size maximums if you try to set size to bigger
value.
4/13
-- If a notebook had many pages (more than some number between 100 and 1300)
then system crashed while terminating.
4/15
-- Fixed a memory violation bug that generated no known symptoms.
-- Martian's advice about how to pause ToonTalk was only partially
updated and he got confused.
-- ToonTalk debugging switches causes logs of events to be generated.
Type names in these logs were wrong.
-- Changed the way robots keep track of items that are put inside something.
-- The 32bit version was using a small cache size.
4/16
-- "Swap if bigger" robot in example notebook was broken.
-- Robots now no longer flip notebooks to page 1 before starting but
do behave as if the main notebook was on page 1 when starting but "flips"
to it only first time the robot sends keyboard characters to notebook.
-- If a picture of a number or text with robots on the back was dropped
on the clipboard remote control then only the text was saved -- now the
entire thing.
-- Geometry of things on clipboard improved.
-- if multiple text pads were dropped on a text pad it sometimes crashed.
4/18
-- Fixed a bug introduced on 4/15 regarding how robots keep track of things.
4/22
-- Fixed a minor bug when displaying short bits of text that are off the side
of the screen.
-- You can now push both the left and right mouse buttons to pause ToonTalk.
4/23
-- While running a replay any mouse button brings up the pause dialog.
-- While holding a notebook you can now use right-mouse to go to next page
and middle-button to go back.
-- 32bit debugger complained about code using SelectObject.  Seemed to
have re-written it so it no longer complains.  No symptoms known.
4/24
-- Fixed a bug introduced on 4/16 that sometimes caused the system to crash
when dealing with the ToonTalk clipboard.
-- Enumeration types (e.g. "your heads looks" which can be "hat", "long hair",
or "bald") when held can now be cycled through using the mouse (middle
is backwards and right is forwards).
4/25
-- Remote controls that are numbers can now be changed by the mouse when
held (middle is backwards and right is forwards).
-- Remote controls that have a limited range (e.g. the "which picture" remote
control now stay in range automatically.
4/26
-- If you put your hand under the Martian's talk balloon, you sometimes got
an image of the balloon even after Marty moved away.
4/29
-- The pasting of a ToonTalk object includes a generated description of
the object.  It was sometimes truncated.
-- Aesthetic changes to pasting of a ToonTalk object.
5/4
-- Nests destruction is postponed until their last bird.  If the house
is being destroyed and contains a nest and the last bird then there was
a problem depending upon the order they were destroyed.  The problem
had no serious consequences.
5/5
-- Sometimes when a robot is trained to use the keyboard while holding
or pointing to a notebook it got confused.
5/7
-- Sometimes when robots in other houses are using the main notebook
and the programmer is as well the response to typing digits to go
to a particular page behaved oddly.
-- Fixed various problems with birds.  E.g. when flying back to her nest
and the nest if being transported by another bird, it led to unpredictable
behavior.
5/8
-- If you hold down F11, then ToonTalk will make snapshots of frames called
frm<number>.bmp where number is the frame number.  Successive identical
frames are not saved.
5/9
-- Fixed more bugs with birds flying outside.
5/10
-- Fixed more bugs with birds flying outside.
-- If a robot is trained to make sounds in another house then it used to
get stuck.
-- If a robot is making sounds in a house and the programmer leaves
the sounds stop.
-- Fixed a bug introduced on 4/26 where if you pointed to an object where
something was on top, the thing on top couldn't be seen.
-- Pictures lost their size if changed by remote controls but not if
changed by the Bike Pump. [Thanks Tobias for pointing this out.]
5/11
-- Fixed more bugs with birds flying outside.
-- Added a new command line switch -bird 0 which makes it so birds take no
time to return after delivering a message.  Good for watching systolic
algorithms. -bird 1 is the default which shows birds returning.
-- Sometimes a bird would put something on her nest in a way in which
you couldn't pick it off (though the vacuum could).
5/12
-- The ToonTalk clipboard used to be confused by programs that copied
using a different convention about how carriage return/line feed work.
(E.g. Netscape didn't work but wordpad did.)
-- For a while now you can put robots in a fresh notebook that were trained to
find other robots in the main notebook (by dropping the label on the notebook).
Used to only work if you found something in the notebook and only got one
copy.
-- Sometimes when pasting text into ToonTalk's clipboard boxes appeared
which were unprintable characters from the carriage reutrn/line feed
problem.
-- For very large text sometimes ToonTalk froze.
5/20
-- Many small changes to what Marty the Martian says.
-- Re-structured internals of Marty so should be easier to translate
to another language
-- Fixed bugs with ordinals like 23th.
5/21
-- More small changes to what Marty says.
-- Marty now describes what can be done with remote controls (and options)
in much more detail, including new ability to use mouse buttons to change
things.
-- Fixed a problem using mouse buttons while holding an address.
5/22
-- Used to be that if the command line set up some options but didn't
specify the user name then it would ask for a user name and if it is
an existing one then the options of that user would override the command
line.
-- One a few machines the full-screen mode is very slow.  It now checks
and warns the user if it is.
-- If there are problems running in full-screen mode (-f 1, e.g. on
Windows NT) it will now switch over to -f 2.
5/23
-- Fixed multiple bugs that occur when a bird's nest is copied and the copies
are in different houses and the bird is given something.
-- When training a bird to receive something whose nest has been copied
it used to copy the bird and message.
5/24
-- It is now easier to return things to the notebook.  If neither page
is empty and something is dropped on top that is on one of the pages then
it is returned regardless of which side of the notebook it is dropped.
-- If only one page is empty and something is dropped on the notebook
it will go to the blank page regardless of which side it was on.
5/26
-- Windows95 version of ToonTalk started.
-- Win95 version uses Direct Sound -- sounds now mix and more audio
features are now feasible.
-- Sound effects notebook on page 8 was missing some newer sounds and
still refering to obsolete sounds.
-- Win95 version does not use the file resind.dat.
5/28
-- If a robot was trained to drop a box on a number it lost track of
things.
-- If a robot performed operations on a sensor, they were remembered
but not seen while inside the thought bubble.
-- Fixed bug introduced on 5/20 where Marty sometimes when describing
what a robot does says things like "the new numbera number".
5/30
-- Robots trained to break a box into pieces by dropping it on a number,
got stuck when running.
-- Sometimes changing the appearance of your head (between hat, bald,
and long hair) corrupted some internal data.
-- Sometimes when lots of birds and/or trucks are using a door then
the programmer can't get through it -- even after the birds and trucks
are done.  Fixed now.
-- If a bird was taking something to her nest in the same room and the
programmer was looking at the house from the outside, you could see the
bird fly out (backwards!) and then fly back in.  No longer.
5/31
-- Sometimes if a number A is dropped on number B and before mouse smashes
them together another number is dropped on A then the system crashed.  Fixed.
-- If a zero-hole box was dropped on another it triggered an error (divide
by zero).
-- If a box was dropped next to a zero hole box, it would not click together.
-- When a small or large box was broken into pieces -- one of the pieces
was default size.
-- If a robot was trained to flip through pages of a notebook then if
the typing was fast it ended up on a different page when it was redoing
the actions.
6/2
-- Fixed recently introduced spurious warning from Marty when dropping
something on a box containing a zero-hole box.
-- Robots trained to drop a box on a blank number got confused when running.
-- Robots trained to drop a box on a number sometimes got confused too.
-- Changes to notebooks made on 5/24 had problem that if something was
dropped on the right page and both left and right was empty it ended up
on the left.
-- When holding something over the notebook, sometimes only one page
wiggled as feedback -- now the entire notebook does.
-- Fixed a rare problem with robots running offscreen that crashed the
system.
-- If more than one bird returns to the same cubby (but different holes)
things got confused.
-- If you dropped a robot on a notebook and quickly flipped pages sometimes
it used to crash.
-- If you dropped a labeled box on a zero-hole box, it looked funny.
-- If you made a zero-hole box blank its size was wrong.
-- If you copied a partially visible picture of a number it used to become
fully visible.
6/3
-- Sometimes if a robot was trained to drop things on a notebook to find
the right page and if that robot is working in another house and the
notebook is open to the page it is looking for it got mixed up about which
page to get things from.
-- Programmed around Borland compiler bug that also occured same time
as above.
-- Sometimes when a bird is returning to a house before it blows up the
memory and other resources taken by the things in the house weren't reclaimed
when the house explodes.
-- If a robot working off screen picked up a random number or mouse sensor
from a notebook it would take a cycle before it became non-zero and might
be used before that.
-- 32 bit version can now have a mucher deeper number of boxes insides
of boxes.
6/4
-- Sometimes when a bird in another house whose nest has been copied
was given something then a copy of the thing appeared on the floor (and
went away if you stood up and sat down again).
6/5
-- Fixed a problem robot's sometimes stop working and stay floating above
everything else.  This also fixes a problem with running some of the demos
with the 32 bit version.
-- Added a new remote control for producing sounds.  This is meant to make
it easier for a user to import their own sounds (Wave and Midi files).
6/6
-- The 32bit version on some systems (especially Windows NT) had the problem
that text and the street were drawn out of order so the helicopter landed
under the street and text floated above things.
6/9
-- If sound is turned off on start up (-s 0 for example) then the 32 bit
version will no longer initialize and later release the Direct Sound
device.
-- If asked for your name and you click on the close box you get asked
again.  If you click on it again then ToonTalk is terminated.  Only need
to do it once now.
6/11
-- Added a new remote control for bringing into ToonTalk user art.  Just
drop the file name on the remote control and then vacuum up the result.
The file should be in Windows BMP format and should work for any format.
If you flip over a user picture and use the remote control for visibility
to make it "see some" then the black bits become transparent.
6/12
-- Fixed a bug with remote control for sound that when vacuumed up
sometimes crashed or hung.
-- Notebooks sometimes if copied and then the copies destroyed lead
to inconsistent memory.
6/16
-- Marty would sometimes make spurious warnings about full screen mode
being too slow.
-- Fixed a bug when vacuuming up a sound created by the "file to sound"
remote control.
-- User defined pictures now can be saved in the notebook, copied, and
used inside of a robot's thought bubble.
-- User defined sounds can now be stopped by vacuuming up the file name.
The file to sound remote control is now restored in the process.
-- Sometimes after taking off a house can be seen being built even
though it was built long ago.
6/17
-- Sometimes door were shown for one frame far to the left of where they
should be.  Trucks driving into the house sometimes drove to this wrong
location of the door.
-- Sometimes when landing near a house being built it looked as if two
trucks drove in.
-- The Windows 95 version now uses DirectSound for the narration and for
user audio.  The sounds are all mixed as a result.
6/18
-- Used to be if you grabbed a truck or something out of it as it was
driving away you could crash the system.
-- Trucks used to "sink" below everything else as they drove off. Looked
bad and stuff inside only partly "dropped" too.
-- If a robot was about to put something in a truck but the programmer
put something in first confusion resulted.
-- If a remote control for converting a file to a sound or picture
was dropped in the notebook it got very small.
-- Remote control for file to sound now has a better size and shape
when on the floor.
-- Better error messages when there is trouble loading a file as a picture
or sound.
-- Can no longer add text to a remote control for file to sound that
already has a file name.
-- When user defined pictures are dropped on the clipboard remote control
then Marty now reminds the user which files need to accompany the "cutting".
-- User pictures in clipboard displayed wrong for all but one copy.
-- If you place a remote sensor for a picture or the clipboard with something
on it into the notebook now the thing "on top" is saved.
6/19
-- The geometry of boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes when expanded
is now improved.
7/2
-- Redid the entire low-level graphics.  The Win95 version now uses
DirectDraw through out.  -v 25 -f 1 now works in the Win95 version
so with a fast machine you get fast, clean, high resolution images.
-- Minor improvement in how the bike pump jumps into your hand when
you press F3
-- F12 now puts a copy of the screen on the clipboard. You can then
paste the result into a paint program or the like.
7/7
-- Fixed problems with localization of ToonTalk to countries where there
is no comma or period seperating every three digits in long numbers.
7/8
-- Fixed a problem in the Win 95 Direct Draw version that transparent
surfaces weren't always initialized properly.
7/9
-- Fixed a serious memory leak introduced about a month ago.
7/16
-- Implemented a whole set of keyboard accelerators (see keyboard.txt).
-- Tools can now be turned on and off.
-- Tools "mode" can be changed via the keyboard.
-- Any keyboard button will pause a demo now.
-- One button mice work better now.  Shift click to fly up.
-- Dropping numbers on text now changes the first or last character
accordingly.
-- Dropping number or text on pictures now by default shows only the
text itself and not the underlying pads.
7/18
-- You can now saved the state of a room by pressing F6 while in it.  Good
for generating puzzles.
7/19
-- Crude puzzle facility operational.  -puzzle <file_name> is the interface.
See puzzle.txt
-- Dropping pictures on the clipboard sometimes crashed.
-- Boxes can now be added to pictures.
7/21
-- You can now get up while holding something and bring it to another house.
-- When text pads are "see some" they no longer try to imitate the spacing
of the invisible pads.
-- You can now paste numbers into ToonTalk.  Previously they appeared
as text pads with digits on them.
-- Fixed how Marty talked about boxes.
7/24
-- Puzzle engine complete.  Supports hints, wall decorations and much more.
-- Fixed a geomtry problem when certain items were created while the
programmer was flying high over the city.
-- If you exited ToonTalk while holding the magic wand it used to crash.
-- The arm didn't quite fit the hand while using a magic wand.
7/26
-- You can now copy the magic wand by pressing 's' while holding it.
-- You can now give an untrained robot a wand and then train him.  He'll
always start off holding the wand.
7/30
-- New experimental input scheme implemented.  Currently -new 1 switch
need to turn it on.  Mouse click now means pick up, then turn on, the
turn off, then drop.  Shift click means pick up, turn on, turn off,
turn on, etc..
7/31
-- Lots more features added to support puzzles.
-- If a box is dropped on a number then you couldn't put anything
in part of the box until you picked up and dropped the box.  Fixed.
8/12
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug where Marty can crash system.
-- Fixed a bug in puzzle mode when training a robot and leaving stuff
in the thought bubble when done training.
-- Introduced a puzzle between 10 and 11 and modified 11.
8/23
-- Simplified puzzle 14
-- Marty sometimes repeated himself when describing what a tool can do.
8/24
-- Modified StartTT.exe to give puzzles as an option.
8/25
-- Fixed many Swedish and a few English grammatical problems with
what Marty says.
-- The comparison of text by scales now follows the alphabetic
ordering conventions of the language that has been set as the
Windows default.
-- If you dropped a picture on its notebook of remote controls and
sensors the system crashed.  Can't any anything to such notebooks
anymore.
8/29
-- 32bit version crashed or behaved badly if run with Windows set
to more than 256 colors.
-- Fixed bugs causing the system to crash while abnormally terminating.
-- Puzzles now have an opening "story book" and Marty looks injured.
8/30
-- Puzzle now starts with user on the ground.
-- Initial greetings when doing puzzles improved.
-- If not starting with first puzzle then doesn't go through intro.
-- The user profile (the USR file) now tracks which was the last
puzzle done.  The command line -next_puzzle 1 runs the next puzzle
(or first one if none done before).
8/31
-- Fixed bug where going in and out of houses caused some birds to
forget to deliver their goods.
-- Fixed a bug where sometimes an object inside of a box disappeared
for a few seconds.
-- Added puzzles 21 to 25 (most of the letter/word puzzles)
9/1
-- Fixed a bug when training a robot to drop something from the magic
wand into the main notebook where it sometimes got confused.
-- Fixed a bug where a robot with an attached wand finishes training
with something attached to his wand.
-- Used to be you could turn on bike pump, vacuum and wand just by
pointing to them and pressing space.  Must be held now.
-- Used to be you could flip a picture by pointing and typing 'f'.
9/9
-- Fixed a bug that caused the first demo (intro.dmo) to stop when
helicopter is taking off.  Also bug made it harder to take off using
mouse buttons.
-- Fixed a bug where a bird is returning to a house that the programmer
is in and its exploding.  Used to crash.
-- Previously if you changed the number of holes in a box (by typing
while holding it or by dropping it on a number) and the box already
was that size nothing happened.  Now a zero-hole box is created.
This way robots can be trained to take off first element of box
and not get confused when box has just 1 hole.
-- Sometimes when a large box was split into pieces the pieces ended
up off-screen.  No longer and geometry improved.
-- Fixed puzzle 14 (add to make birth year) where it thought you
were 96 years old.
9/10
-- Sound effect notebook had pages alternating between sound label
(e.g. "helicopter sound") and sound names ("helicopter").  Sound
labels have been eliminated but change won't take effect until
version 5.

few intermediate puzzles.
-- Boxes no longer respond to the keyboard during puzzles.
-- Marty's response to bringing back an incomplete solution was
improved.
9/12
-- A few puzzles require the state of the previous puzzle.  If you
now quit on such puzzles you'll start again on the previous one
next time.
-- Puzzles that provide a robot trained in a previous puzzle would
crash if not solved the first time.
9/13
-- Fixed problem where StartTT lauched puzzle mode with the wrong switches
so you couldn't leave a room holding something.
9/15
-- The 16bit version read numbers larger than 64K as text strings.
-- Audio was missing from pump and vacuum when turned on.
9/17
-- If there is something wrong with the DAT files, you got a warning
and then it crashed.

it'll go back to where it was before (and that size as well).
-- Default sizes and positions of tools changed.
-- When the toolbox opens up in the thought bubble and the tools come
out, the animation was very abrupt.  Now is smooth.
9/22

line on the top.
-- 16 bit version had the problem that if something was under something
with text or numbers on it and you pointed to the lower thing then
a moving thin horizontal line would break the text.
-- If you copy the result of pasting the contents of a room into
Window's clipboard and take out the clipboard remote control then
the objects are restored to the room.  Great for revising puzzles.
-- Updated the first puzzle to have a reminder about how to get up.

updated.
-- Messages on the walls in puzzles now look much nicer.

more to say.
-- Puzzles now have bombs so that it is easy to reset the puzzle.
If you now bring Marty the wrong thing you don't lose what you brought

handed.  -bomb 0 on the command line restores the old behavior.
-- About 10 new puzzles added.

blank (except in thought bubbles).  The tilt is based on the original
value for blank text or number pads.

involved even though they matched and others didn't.  Now it gives
up as it should.

mistakenly think that there was a traing counter and it was used up.
-- 'B' for blank for vacuum was replaced by 'E' for erase.
12/22
-- Reworked many internal parts of Marty so that he is easier to
translate to other languages.
-- Fixed a bug when Marty tried to describe some kinds of remote
controls while they were still in a notebook.
12/26

will work accross different language version of ToonTalk.  The
old way of typing a name still works but generates a warning.
-- Sensors that display text, (e.g. "yes" or "no" for whether
the left mouse button is down) are now saved in the natural language
of the system they came from.  This way things saved can be brought
into other language versions of ToonTalk and still work fine.
-- If you tried to return something to the notebook of remote controls
(that lives on the back of pictures) you got a warning from Marty
rather than just let the item fall back on the notebook.
12/30
-- Added subtitles to demos.  Adding -subtitles 100 to the command line
turns them on. (Larger numbers indicate a faster speed for the subtitles.)
Can also turn them on by adding "SubtitlesSuffix=ust"
to the "Executables" section of ToonTalk.ini.  Where UST is the
American English subtitles suffix.
1/7
-- Fixed spelling of twelfth. (Thanks to Jay Schmoll and Kelly Johnson
for pointing this out.)

even if he didn't have more to say he tried to repeat himself when you
came back.
1/8
-- Can no longer resize the Start ToonTalk application.
1/9
-- While running ToonTalk in full screen mode if you type a Window's
command like Alt-Tab or Ctrl-Esc confusion used to result.  ToonTalk
is now paused and minimized in this situation. 
(Thanks to Jay Schmoll and Kelly Johnson for pointing this out.)
1/14

you quit and started again then the robots previously trained were lost.
-- Fixed the geometry of pictures of the goal for a few puzzles.
-- Titles no longer trigger the teleport in sound.
1/17
-- Sometimes copying a nest with things on it led to unpredicable
behavior.
-- If you erased something (made it blank) with Dusty and then
put it on the back of a picture or in another house and then
put Dusty in reverse it would be restored.  Now Dusty only
restores blank things that are on the screen.
1/19
-- If ToonTalk's speed is changed it no longer affects the speed
that Marty talks or that subtitles are shown.
1/20
-- Fixed a recent problem with training robots on boxes that contain
covered nests.
-- Fixed some problems in how Marty gives help in using bombs.
1/23
-- Marty can talk!!!! (But only in the 32 bit version and currently
 I'm using a speech engine that I don't have the right to redistribute.)
 -speak 1 will turn it on
 -balloon 0 will turn off talk balloons
-- Scales can now be changed by typing ' ', '+', or '-' if they are totering
or have blanks on both sides of them. (Thanks to Leo Burd for noticing that
this feature was broken.)
-- F1 quickly following F1 was ignored -- works now.  (Thanks to Jay Kahn
for reporting this.)
-- If running with text-to-speech you can shift-click a text pad and it'll
be spoken.
-- You can now have subtitles to demos spoken.
1/26
-- Some puzzles (like #6) depend upon the previous puzzle.  If you set
off the bomb in such a puzzle you were left with an empty floor.  All
you could do is restart ToonTalk and the puzzle would be restored
properly.  Fixed now.
-- If you copy Dusty the vacuum you now also copy what's in his stomach.
-- If a nest is copied or saved and it has 100s of things on top then
the system crashed.  This happened frequently solving puzzle p42.pzl.
(Thanks to Phil Mercurio for reporting this.)
1/28
-- If -language <name> is missing or misspelled then Versions entry
for "Language" in toontalk.ini is used.  If that is missing then
American English is chosen.

F8 won't stop them if they are already running.
-- You can put a text pad in a truck and it'll end up in the
new house.
-- Fixed a bug when doing puzzles that sometimes crashed when
blowing up the house or entering the rocket.  (introduced on 1/26)
-- If you use -puzzle to specify which puzzle and that puzzle
depends upon the previous puzzle for the items on the floor
of the house then there is nothing there now.  Used to be
you'd seen the stuff from the last puzzle you did.
-- If you run demos with narration on a machine without a sound
card the system could crash.
2/16
-- Fixed a bug where when Marty is describing a robot whose thought
bubble includes blank boxes it could crash.
-- If you dropped a truck with stuff inside on the notebook it lost
the stuff inside.  (Also if you dropped a loaded truck on the stack
of trucks in Tooly it was returned.)
-- When you copied a truck some of the stuff inside wasn't copied.
-- Robot's now have serial numbers visible on their chests.
2/17
-- Puzzles that required the saving of very large amount of state
behaved erratically.  For example, in p42.pzl if the nest contains
more than 1000 numbers it used to cause problems.
3/1
-- If you copied a picture with a wand in "original" mode then the
things on the back were also restored.  For example, the Ping Pong
ball so it would not bounce.
-- Adjusted the way mouse movements are mapped to ToonTalk movements
to increase sensitivity when window is small and screen is big.
3/6

many puzzles) and the wand was set down and later picked up and used
then sometimes robots got mixed up.
-- Robots sometimes held magic wands behind them -- looked stupid.
-- You can now put trucks, notebooks, robots, and bombs in boxes.  Robots
can be trained to use these things.
-- You can now drop a notebook in a truck and that will be the notebook
used by the robots in the new house.
-- ToonTalk to Java translator now works for everything except pictures,
sounds, and remote controls.   If you pause ToonTalk while holding a
robot or truck, then a corresponding Java applet will be created and displayed.
-- You can also drop a text pad in a truck and it'll end up in the new
house.
-- If you put a text pad in a truck and then generate a Java applet it will
get its name from the text pad rather than generating one.
3/7
-- Fixed a bug with trucks that are stopped (F8) and fully loaded
and animations are finished instantly.
-- ToonTalk to Java translator can now handle the random number remote.
3/10
-- Fixed a bug where a robot had a remote control in its thought bubble
that has been erased (by Dusty).  Sometimes system would crash when
blowing up a house with such a robot in it.
3/14
-- The Toontalk to Java translator now generates comments as well.
3/19
-- Marty can talk!  Only in the 32 bit version though.
3/20

puzzles.
-- When Marty tries to repeat what he was saying before you left the rocket
(in puzzles) he now doesn't repeat as much.
-- Text to speech now works with sound on (though sound is turned off when
Marty is around).  (Waiting for Microsoft SAPI 3.0 to deal with this well.)

of expressions (like 1,000).
-- Redid the autostart application (CDROM only) to offer an installation
choice on the first screen.
-- When you leave the rocket speech now stops (and sound effects are
restored regardless).
-- PageDown now works with speech as well.  Current sentence is interrupted
and Marty skips to the next.
4/7
-- Greatly improved the synchrnoization between Marty's talk balloons and
spoken speech.
-- While training a robot the robot can now move offscreen a bit -- used to
be you sometimes couldn't pick up something you dropped near the edge.
-- A robot trained to pick up and drop the whole toolbox got mixed up.
-- Sometimes a special message from Marty after solving a puzzle was lost.
(E.g. sometimes after p16.pzl).
-- Fixed a bug in the way Marty said Swedish numbers between 1000000 and 2000000.
4/8
-- Robot serial numbers over 1000 now look better.
-- Sometimes sound effects were lost if left a room while Marty was talking
(out loud).
-- Sometimes if you start with a particular puzzle (using -puzzle on the
command line) then the things you make were placed at the wrong place in
the rocket.
-- Sometimes if you start with a particular puzzle (using -puzzle on the
command line) then you would reach a puzzle that depends upon stuff made
earlier.  Now a warning and advice is given.
-- If you have a nest in your pocket and a robot is repeatedly giving the
bird something then you'll now see the bird deliver the stuff to you and return.
-- Fixed a problem saving the state of puzzles after puzzle 40.
-- City is now smaller when running puzzles.
-- Can no longer cheat during puzzles by "stealing" the magic wand from
a robot who has been trained to set it down.
4/11
-- If you train a robot to drop something in a hole, and then vacuum away
(or erase) the whole box from his thought bubble and give him a box with
fewer holes you now get a reasonable error message.
4/13
-- Improved the way ToonTalk internally keeps track of what scene an
object is currently part of.
-- Fixed a bug when blowing up the house in puzzle p53.pzl
-- Marty now describes boxes with many short sentences rather than one long one.
-- Fixed a bug that happened when you stood up holding a box while a robot was working
on the box.
-- Fixed a problem displaying large boxes (100s or 1000s of holes).
-- Set a maximum number of holes for a box since the system slows
down terribly as they get to be several 1000 long.  2048 is the max now.
4/14
-- If you used Dusty in reverse while over a stack (in the toolbox or a notebook)
then copies of the stack item were made.
-- If you dropped the wand and then mouse clicked without moving the mouse
sometimes you got the thing last pointed to by the tip of the wand.
-- In high resolution (-v 25) with a hat sometimes the hat was wrapped around
so that the edge of it was behind his head.

the bird now flies there if needed.
4/15

-- Redid bank account demo.
-- Changed 32bit implementation so that EXE files are about 1M smaller.
(They share the file "resind" with the 16 bit version.)

though Marty didn't appear.
-- Fixed bugs with text-to-speech and sound effects switching.
4/16
-- A bird on the floor when given something didn't quite return to where
she started but drifted.  No longer.
-- The user profile USR and LOG files now on Win 95 can be over 200 characters
long.  Previously (and still in Win 3.1) if 2 users shared the first 8 letters
they were considered the same user.
-- If training a robot in a puzzle with a training counter it no longer counts
if you just drop or pick up the magic wand.
4/19
-- Used to be if you dropped something into a truck that was in a box it would
crash.  Thanks to Katherine Nelson for reporting this.
-- Sometimes things inside of a box that was on a notebook page didn't display
right.
-- Fixed a new problem where Marty (with speech off) would put several sentences
in a talk balloon with a small font.
4/21
-- Fixed a bug in the 32 bit version where on some machines if you paused and
returned some images were clobbered.
-- On some machines the first Ping Pong demo took a very long time in the titles.
-- If puzzle files are not installed on the hard disk but are on the CDROM,
it now reads them from the CDROM.
4/22
-- If you are running off the CDROM and your drive is fast enough you can now
remove the TempDir entry from toontalk.ini and ToonTalk will no longer load
files from the CDROM to temporary hard drive files.
-- It used to be that if you put the Toolbox down offscreen that you couldn't
pick him up again.  Now a little bit is always visible and it is graspable.
-- Marty no longer mentions that text objects that spell a sound can be used
to make the sound since this is this way of making sounds is being phased out.
-- Fixed a problem with puzzle p51 where the number became exactly 3000 rather
than larger.
-- Marty now does a better job of describing the clipboard remote control.
-- Once again if you change the size or position of the toolbox or the tools
that live inside him (Dusty, Pumpy, etc.) then when you restart ToonTalk
the tools will be the size and position you indicated.
-- Sometimes the 32 bit version would lose sound effects if the text-to-speech
engine couldn't initialize properly.
-- If you start up ToonTalk, pause it, click on come back later and then
start up ToonTalk again with the same user name then the old ToonTalk is
activated.
4/23
-- Training a robot to put a notebook in a truck caused multiple problems.
-- Robots got confused if you trained one to put a nest on the floor and then
put things in the nest.
-- If you change the size of the Tool Box then the items inside get a smaller
or bigger normal size when retrieved.  This is now also true for robots that
remove things from the Tool Box.
-- If you trained a robot to vacuum up the main notebook, or send it off in
a truck with a robot that blows up that house then ToonTalk crashed since
the main notebook was destroyed.  No longer.
4/24
-- Robot's using magic wands now drop things more accurately.
-- Marty described scales strangely.  Thanks to Lennart and Tobias for pointing this out.
5/7
-- Fixed a problem where things on top of nests inside of boxes sometimes
displayed themselves with the wrong size.
-- If a robot was contained in something (a box or a truck) which was in a notebook
and the robot was trained to get something out of a notebook then he didn't use
the notebook he came from.  Does now.
-- Sometimes when the sensor notebook is opened and the keyboard is heavily
used then a bit of memory was accessed that shouldn't.  Debugging tools caught
this but not clear if there are any symptoms.
5/8
-- The 16 bit version of ToonTalk cannot import pictures that are bigger than
64K and only if they have 256 colors.  Marty now gives a warning and nothing
is imported.
-- On a few systems exiting ToonTalk with Alt-F4 caused a Direct Draw error.
-- If you set off a bomb and then quickly pressed "Esc" to stand up, sometimes
the house would not explode until you went back inside.  But then Tooly the
ToolBox doesn't make it out OK.  Fixed now.
-- Sometimes copying something in the thought bubble of a robot crashes the
system.  No longer.
-- A robot trained to drop a box on a number sometimes got confused.
-- A sensor all by itself on a notebook page was the wrong size.
-- If you dropped a truck with a robot inside on a notebook sometimes a copy
of the robot stayed around until you left the floor.
5/12
-- Fixed many ToonTalk to Java bugs.
-- The generated Java code can now be run as an applet or as an application.
5/14
-- A bird sometimes forgot to deliver something.  If it then returned to a house
that blew up the item was destroyed improperly.  Could lead to a crash.
-- Fixed various problems associating with shift-clicking text when text-to-speech
is available.
-- Fixed a problem that occurred when more than 128 things were on the screen
at once.
-- Fixed many ToonTalk to Java bugs dealing with trucks.
5/15
-- When things collided then there was a 50% chance that the sensor would
detect it one frame later.  So if you wanted them both to react to the
collision the delayed one might not still be colliding on the next frame.
Thanks to Kevin O'Brien for pointing out this problem.
-- If 2 objects were moving very quickly relative to their size then they
used to be able to pass through each other without a collision detector
noticing.  No longer.
5/21
-- Finished major re-write of Java classes for running translated ToonTalk.
No longer heavily uses Java threads.  Display of results improved.
5/22
-- Fixed a bug where a robot lost track of stuff when something was put in
a box, taken out, and then something was put into it.
-- After training a robot, the limits on how far your arm can go offscreen
were not restored so it was easy to move your arm off screen and "lose" it.
-- If a robot was working somewhere in the city and was sending key strokes
to the main notebook (looking for a page), then if you picked up the notebook
you stopped the robot.  Also the robot running elsewhere messed up the
size of the items on the first pages of the notebook temporarily.
5/23
-- Fixed a bug where a notebook shared by lots of robots in different houses
is destroyed.  (Demo2 of Sentence Maker example could trigger this after waiting
long enough in heliocopter while it is running.)
5/25
-- Fixed a bug with the sensor for detecting if the control button was down.
5/26
-- Fixed a bug where a text pad was sent off in a truck and then the new house
with the pad was visited.
-- Sometimes while exiting ToonTalk while tools are coming out of Tooly system
would crash.
5/27
-- Fix on 5/22 where robot lost track of stuff broke when a robot dropped things
on a number (or text pad) on the floor.
-- Fixed a few problems with ToonTalk to Java translator when magic wand
was used more than once without setting it down.
5/28
-- If a bird comes back to a box to find it now occupied, she'll fly around and
wait.  If you then got up (or set off a bomb) the system crashed.  Also she
flew around in a goofy manner.
-- If a bird is returning to a box that has been vacuumed she now stops.
5/29
-- If a notebook page contains something that uses collision detection and
you leave that page the system used to crash.  Problem introduced on 5/15.
(Thanks to dcornell for pointing this out.)
-- Fixed a bug from 5/22 where while training a robot it can be way off-screen.
-- Fixed a bug where a robot during training picks up a many-holed box and it
gets wider and wider.
5/30
-- Many small changes to the way Marty describes things, especially remote controls.
6/2
-- Sometimes Marty when talking about pictures would include a ) when there was
no (.
6/8
-- Translator to Java now supports pictures and sounds.  Nearly everything
(all the example programs for example) now run fine in a Web browser.
6/11
-- Java equivalents of ToonTalk programs that use pictures (e.g. Ping Pong) run
about twice as fast now.
6/12
-- Java now supports global sensors for keyboard and mouse.
-- If a robot was trained to with a box with a sensor with a text display
(like shift button down sensor) then in the thought bubble it was replaced
with the empty string.  It now is replaced by a string corresponding to its last state.
If this isn't what is desired one can always replace the text in the thought bubble.
6/13
-- Add new kinds of synthetic images.  In addition to rectangles the pictures
notebook now contains ovals, lines, rounded rectangles, etc.
6/16
-- Java now queries the user for values if an empty box hole is matched against something.
6/21
-- If a picture is a rectangle with pictures on top and its visibility is set to
see some then the pictures on top will be visible and the rectangle will not.
6/23
-- It once again works to drop a flipped picture on top of a flipped picture.
The picture underneath will act as if all the robots and boxes have been dropped
on it. This is a very useful way of adding or combining behaviors.
-- If you train a robot by giving him boxes containing remote controls they
automatically are erased for the thought bubble. This now also works if you
remove the box from his thought bubble and replace it.
-- If you flip over a picture with pictures on top then its notebook contains
a copy of the pictures on top and a notebook for each one.  The copies now have
robots and boxes on the back if the original did.
6/27
-- ToonTalk to Java translator now uses labels on boxes to generate prompts if
needed.  If a box is empty or contains a nest without a bird and it is matched
against some value then the user is asked for a value.  The label under that
hole is used if there is one.  If a bird without nest is given something its
nest will be labeled by the label in the hole the bird is in.  If there are
no labels a generic message is used.
6/30
-- Fixed a problem with the Ping Pong demos caused by the addition of new pictures.
-- When text-to-speech is used without talk balloons Marty would sometimes leave
before finishing what he was saying.
-- The remote control for looks now behaves properly when made blank and given
a new appearance.
-- The remote control for looks now becomes a controller of the picture whose
back it is dropped on.
-- Flipped pictures did not always clip the pictures on the back properly so,
for example, thought bubbles sometimes stuck out behind the edge of the flipped
picture.
7/3
-- Things on the back of pictures are now automatically layed out in tiling fashion.
7/22
-- If a robot on the back of a picture loads up a truck with another robot and box
then they now end up on the back of the picture as well.
-- If a robot on the back of a picture loses the box he is working on (e.g. he
was vacuumed it up or put it in a truck for another robot to work on) then he
also disappears from the back of the picture since he can no longer do anything.
-- Sometimes if a trained robot picked something up and changed it (e.g. the number
of holes of a box) and released it the size would be wrong.
7/23
-- Redid Ping Pong Demo (part 3).
-- ToonTalk is now more responsive to mouse movements (maximum speed in various
contexts has been reduced).
-- If Marty needs to say something that he can't speak (an error message from MCI
for now) he will switch to using talk balloons for a minute.
-- Make some error messages more important (so they come through even if Marty's
default talk level is increased to 4).
7/29
-- Beta 8 released
8/1
-- Fixed a bug with birds and exploding houses (e.g. sentences demo) that crashed system.
-- Fixed bug in translator to Java when making something empty (e.g. a hole of a box).
8/4
-- Fixed a bug in translator to Java when a notebook has a truck with a robot in it.
-- Fixed a bug in translator to Java when a robot uses a notebook.
-- You can no longer vacuum things out of a remote control notebook of a picture.
(Thanks to Katherine Nelson for pointing out this problem.)
-- On puzzle #49 (blow up the other house) if you blew up the wrong house and went
back to the rocket the system would crash.  No longer.
(Thanks to Katherine Nelson for pointing out this problem.)
-- When in puzzle #62 you flipped the number, the system crashed.  No longer.
(Thanks to Katherine Nelson for pointing out this problem.)
-- Sometimes when a robot picked up a box it gradually grew wider and wider.
No longer.
-- When Windows was running with more than 256 colors, then the 16 bit version showed
the subtitles as black on black.
(Thanks to Katherine Nelson for pointing out this problem.)
-- When Windows was running with more than 256 colors, when exiting the 32 bit version
full-screen mode then errors would occur and leave Windows with 256 colors.
8/5
-- Fixed the release information on the opening screen.
-- Fixed one of the images of Tooly, the toolbox, settling down.  Used to have a purple fringe.
-- Now when ToonTalk is running in full-screen mode and loses the focus (e.g.
Alt-Tab or Ctrl-Esc or another application grabbing it), you now get a specialized
dialog for the occasion.  Also if Windows was running more than 256 colors, it
used to be reset to 256 colors when this happened.
8/6
-- Sometimes when two robots were working together and the programmer wasn't watching
either one, then one of them would lose track of things and stop.  Fixed.
-- Java translator had a problem if a notebook containing a truck containing a robot
was encountered.
-- F9 now only hides your hand and arm but not what you are holding.
-- Beta 8A released
8/9
-- If StartTT.exe has problems launching ToonTalk it now describes the problem
in the file c:\StartTT.log
-- StartTT didn't work right if ToonTalk was installed so that the path name
was too many characters.
8/11
-- If a problem occured while running a puzzle then starting again sometimes
caused the same problem.  Fixed at least for some of the special puzzles that
depend upon earlier puzzles.
-- If ToonTalk is started on a puzzle that requires things from an earlier puzzle
but they aren't available it now offers to send you back a few puzzles.
-- 8A introduced a bug where if ToonTalk wanted to put up a message box, then
it would first put up the "pause dialog".  Fixed now.
-- Began using Microsoft Speech SDK 3.0.  Text-to-speech handles aprostophes
differently so needed to change ToonTalk accordingly.
8/13
-- If any file is missing from the hard disk, ToonTalk now reads it from the CDROM
(if it was installed from a CDROM). It now asks the user to insert the CDROM if
it is not.
-- If an argument to the -language switch is unknown then the first 2 letters are
taken to be the country code and files named XXttYY.dll and XXsttYY.dll (where
XX is the country code and YY is 16 or 32 depending upon which version of ToonTalk
is being loaded) are loaded.  This permits a released version of ToonTalk to be
localized after the fact.
8/19
-- Fixed a bug when "taking control" of a demo how you can't pause it properly
after that.
-- Fixed a bug where ToonTalk was trying to ask for the CDROM but didn't have
the string library loaded yet.
-- 8/22
-- Finished complete re-write of installation program.  Can install and un-install
separate components.  Should be more robust and flexible than old one.  And it
looks more "modern".
-- Fixed a bug where the toolbox didn't make it out of an exploding house when
the power was off.
(Thanks to Katherine Nelson for pointing out this problem.)
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug in reading the history of user.  May have
caused strange behavior on Windows NT 4.0.
8/23
-- Many small improvements to the wording of what Marty says.
-- When Marty describes a sensor that has been operated upon (e.g. "\2" was
dropped on it) then he interrupted his description with some advice.  The
sentence order now makes sense.
8/25
-- Fixed a problem generating Java applets if a robot flipped something over
while holding it.
-- Fixed problems with some of the comments generated for Java.
-- Fixed problems with some of the comments generated for Java in Swedish.
-- Even though most puzzles disable typing of text (too easy to cheat) ToonTalk
allowed typing anyway.  (Thanks to Tobias Zetterlund for pointing this out.)
-- ToonTalk also allowed pictures to be flipped even if a puzzle switch disabled
this.
8/26
-- Fixed various bugs that interferred with puzzles 63, 64 and 65.
-- Changed the policy about pictures (or numbers) with robots on the back.  They
no longer stop when picked up or dropped in a box.
-- A box with a picture with robots on the back now starts working when taken out
of a notebook.
-- Puzzle 61 allowed players to bring any number back.
-- Expanded the hints in puzzle 65.
8/27
-- If the argument to -I on the command line contained an extension (.DMO) then
it would only work if it was a fully-qualified path name.  No longer.
-- Added 5 more puzzles.
8/28
-- If a number was flipped over twice, then put in a notebook and then taken out
and dropped on a picture the number and the underlying number pad were added to
the picture.  Now just the number is added.
8/29
-- Added 4 more puzzles.
-- After solving the last puzzle you needed to come back to Marty for him to
tell you so.
-- If you solved all the puzzles and start "Play Game" then you are now given
the option of starting over again.
-- The command line now permits file names (e.g. puzzle or demo names) to have
spaces in them as many Windows 95 files do.  Do not use - in names however as
that may confuse things.
8/31
-- Fixed a bug where system crashed sometimes during training a robot during
puzzles if the robot picked up the box it was given.
-- Puzzle #54 now works by waiting for the bird to deliver the message.
-- Used to be you could make a team of robots some of who haven't been trained
yet.
-- Puzzles that involve results that are dynamic (have robots on the back) are
now checked properly.  And Marty responds appropriately to different sorts of
wrong dynamic answers.
-- If a robot is starting to work on a box or is waiting for a sensor to change
and the box is near the top of the screen the robot would go off the top fo the
screen.
-- Flipping a picture back over with robots on the back now starts them up
(used to be that you had to drop it first).
-- Flipping a picture over used to stop the robots on the back for good.  Now
they are stopped only until it is flipped back.
-- Sometimes dynamic things posted on the wall of the broken rocket stopped
running after a while.
9/1
-- If successive puzzles left the solution in your hand for the next puzzle and
you reset (bombed) the house sometimes you got a previous thing in your hand.
-- Marty would not jump to the next sentence when really speaking when a player
clicked the mouse inside the rocket.
-- When you solve the last puzzle Marty now says new things and as a present
adds your age in seconds to the sensor notebook.
-- Robots now have generated names (unless the GenerateRobotNames switch in
toontalk.ini has been set to 0). Thanks to Jerry Balzano for the suggestion.
-- Fixed a problem where the system crashed while the Java applet generator
tried to generate long comments (describing complex items).
-- Fixed various bugs when generating a Java applet that has robots on the
back of a picture that in turn is in a box on the back of another picture.
-- Java applets didn't quite do the right thing when scales were used with
numbers with robots on the back.
9/2
-- Fixed various Java applet bugs.
-- Java applets of numbers or text with robots on the back no longer generate
a picture of the number (that didn't look good anyway).
-- Java applets that didn't generate a picture flickered badly.
-- Java applets now run (and compile) using archives.  This among other things
means they can run off the CDROM which doesn't have long file names.
9/3
-- There is now an internal list of "bad" robot names that are not used.
-- Fixed bugs in Java applets that used operations on remote controls.
-- Java applets now work if the robot was trained to use the main notebook
(that lives inside Tooly).
9/4
-- If you dropped a box on a picture and then vacuumed it out it didn't quite
behave like a box anymore.  You no longer can add a box to a picture.  Thanks
to Tobias Zetterlund for reporting this.
-- Fixed a bug in Java applets when a robot was trained to change the pages
of a notebook without picking it up.
-- Fixed a problem with Java applets when a robot was trained to change the
color of a synthetic picture.
-- Fixed problems with Java applets when a robot changed notebook pages in
certain ways.
9/5
-- The Java pictures and sounds needed for Java applets using them can now reside
on either the hard disk or CD-ROM.
-- If after copying something (e.g. a number) a robot was trained to use the keyboard
while still holding the wand with the attached item, then the corresponding Java
applet didn't work.  Also Marty described the robot incorrectly.
-- In both ToonTalk and Java applets if a random number had some operations
performed (e.g. adding 1000) and it was copied then the copy did not have
the operations performed until the next cycle.
-- Java applets that use pictures can now run either in a separate window
or inside the browser.  The Switch "RunAppletInNewWindow" in ToonTalk.ini controls
this.
-- Java applets now by default receive their name from the first robot involved.
9/8
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug that prevented Start ToonTalk from starting
demos because the names had a space added at the end.  Preceeding and trailing
spaces in file names are now ignored.
-- The compilation of Java applets can now occur with the needed files on the
CDROM.
9/9
-- Fixed a problem with training robots to drop pictures on pictures.
-- Fixed a problem with trained robots flipping a picture over and using the
remote controls in the picture's notebook.
-- The compilation of the Java applet can now use a compiler on the CD-ROM if
one has not been installed on the hard disk.
-- Made minor improvements to the installation script.
-- Made minor improvements to the wording of puzzles #61 and #62.
-- The command line -puzzle <file_name> has been extended
to allow -puzzle <puzzle_number> as well.
-- Revised puzzle #51 so that the second number can be greater than OR EQUAL TO
3000 now.
-- Revised puzzle #68 so it differs from #67 only in the use of the keyboard to
initialize the numbers
-- On some puzzle #64 the robot had an invisible wand (actually it was 0 units
tall).
9/10
-- Blank pages added to the end of notebooks are now ignored. It used to be that
you could not return a notebook to a stack if you had flipped past the last
non-blank page.
-- Java applets did not work if a robot was trained to add things to a remote
control for the looks of something.
-- Java applets did not work if a robot was trained to get a notebook from a
picture and use the remote controls.
-- When Dusty is turned on to reverse to restore things that he erased he did too
many all at once.  He now waits a second between each restoration.
-- Changed the way power off (F8) is displayed so that it still is obvious but
it looks better.  (Permutes colors rather than drop a black mask on top.)
9/11
-- Recovers better from errors while generating Java applets.
-- Deals better with missing media when generating Java applets.
-- If a user closed the box asking his or her name then the string library was
left open. This wasted resources and interferes with installation.
9/15
-- Fixed a misspelling in puzzle #62 and ran a spell checker on puzzles 61 to 74.
-- Changed "dottled" to "dotted" in Pictures notebook.
-- Fixed the wording of puzzle #67. ("minute" to "minutes timer")
-- Updated the text-to-speech engine with new things Marty says.
-- If you haven't used ToonTalk for a while, you now get a dialog box asking you
if you want to Marty to suggest things that you once did but might have forgotten.
-- Marty when speaking would occassionally get stuck -- fixed.
9/16
-- If you shrank the magic wand and then copied things that were inside of other
things the copies ended up floating off the bottom of the screen. Thanks to
Magnus Knutssonfor reporting this.
-- If you broke a blank box (either by keyboarding a smaller number of holes or
dropping it on a small number) then only one piece was blank and the other not.
-- If you copied a blank box and then changed the number of holes in the copy
an error occurred.
9/17
-- You can now control your persona by using a joystick (as well as a mouse or
the arrow keys).  32-bit version only.
9/19
-- If ToonTalk had troubles loading something that was in a truck it looped.
-- ToonTalk had troubles loading blank notebooks inside of other things.
-- The internal workings of sensors and remote controls was re-worked to be
more extensible and faster.
-- If you have one or more joysticks connected to your PC and you are running
the 32-bit version of ToonTalk then at the end of your sensor notebook you'll
find a sensor notebook for the state and buttons of the joystick.
9/20
-- Fixed a bug when StartTT is running in auto demo mode when a demo finished
it might violate memory.
-- Fixed another problem running auto demo mode where at the end of each demo
a dialog box appeared saying ToonTalk was stopped by another program (it was
the StartTT program).
9/22
-- Extra joystick buttons (and middle and right mouse buttons) are now user
customizable by adding entries in toontalk.ini. (See www.toontalk.com/English/ttini.htm)
9/23
-- Sometimes ToonTalk would be interrupted by another problem, put up an
appropriate dialog box but then crash when resumed.
-- Joystick sensors are now natural language sensitive.
-- If a connected joystick isn't calibrated then when the 32-bit version is started
the helicopter drifts off to an edge. This is now detected and a dialog explaining
what to do about this is started.
-- Improved the way in which ToonTalk put up a message box and restored things
afterwards.
9/26
-- The sensor "File to Sound" was enhanced so that you can remove a sound from it
and use it (by pressing the space bar) to make sounds.
-- 2 new sensors were added to the sensor notebook (on page 4). "Text to Speech"
works on the 32-bit version of ToonTalk and will speak the text (or spell it if
the words aren't known). "Text to MCI" sends the text on the pad to Microsoft's
Media Controller Interface. For both of these you can vacuum off the sound (or
other media) and just use it.
-- Unless overridden by -new_input 0 on the command line, when you type while
holding or pointing to a sound, then the sound is made. You can no longer make
text be spoken or send it to MCI -- instead you should use the sensors described
above.
9/28
-- Fixed a memory leak in the 32-bit version.
-- The second mouse button (or second joystick button) now flips over pictures, text,
and numbers (if -b 2).
-- If you change the "Which Picture" number from a notebook on the back of a
flipped over number or text pad then the number (like with geometric objects)
changes the color of the text.
9/30
-- Fixed several memory leaks
10/2
-- Fixed a problem with reading narration files from a CDROM.
-- Fixed a problem with the color of text and sound pads when too small to have text.
-- Fixed a problem where if a team of robots was on the back of a picture that
all but the first robot was very narrow.
-- Fixed a problem where Marty would say "the a picture of" or "the a movie of".
10/3
-- Fixed a recently introduced but where robots lost track of things when trained
to change the size of a box using the keyboard.
-- If a team of more than 2 robots stopped, then when you picked up one they didn't
form a line again until dropped.
-- Fixed a recently introduced but in the global mouse speed sensors that showed
much too small a value.
10/5
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug in generating a Java applet from a ToonTalk
program that uses remote controls.
-- Discovered that the optimized version of TT32 had a bug which showed up on the
first puzzle.  Changed the optimization settings and problem is gone.
-- Fixed a bug where if you grabbed Dusty while he was morphing to inert then
he was inert in your hand.
10/7
-- Fixed a bug in new input scheme for how to use Pumpy with the right mouse button.
-- Fixed a problem with running user added demos that lack narration and subtitles.
-- If a user is asked to insert the CDROM and agrees but clicks on "retry" before
the disk has spun up they now get another chance.
-- Fixed various bugs in the new input scheme (using the right mouse button).
-- Beta 8C released.
10/8
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug where a robot trained to use Dusty didn't behave
right.
-- Fixed a bug where Marty would repeatedly say why a robot stopped if many were
stopping for the same reason.
-- When Marty says a robot stopped he now gives the robot's name.
-- When Marty is speaking (text-to-speech) sometimes he would get stuck with a
blank talk balloon or break a word accross balloons.
-- Robots got mixed up sometimes when they were trained to drop a text pad on
a notebook (other than the main one).
-- If a robot was being trained and was holding another robot or the like and
ToonTalk was paused then a Java applet was generated -- should only work when
the programmer is holding it.
-- If you took control from a demo then the old input scheme was in effect.  No
longer.
-- While training a robot if a notebook other than the main was picked up then
its size was made too small.
10/10
-- Sounds sometimes were not made by robots on the back of pictures.
-- Sounds were sometimes stopped prematurely by robots.
-- Updated the robot accross from the "Say" page of the Sentences notebook in
the Examples notebook to work with the new sound primitives.
10/13
-- Fixed a problem pausing on the opening screen.
-- The 32-bit version didn't release a library resource.
-- Fixed a variety of memory leaks.
-- You can now sit down outside and whatever you leave on the ground will be
add to the city.  (To call the helicopter you can no longer click a mouse button
since that is for sitting.  'H' and 'h' still call it.)
-- Robots on the back of pictures kept working even when the flipping the picture
over.  Caused confusion.
10/14
-- If you add to the "User" section of toontalk.ini an entry DefaultUser=<name>
then the user profile and notebooks of name will be available to new users. A
good way to customize ToonTalk for a group.
-- You can now use left and right mouse buttons together to act like "escape"
to stand up or leave a thought bubble.  Works only if -b <n> where n is greater
than 1.
10/15
-- If a bomb was set off doing puzzle #6 then the floor of the re-built house
was empty.
-- If a user quit just after solving puzzle #5 then when ToonTalk is restarted
puzzle #5 used to have to be re-solved.
-- Made various improvements is what Marty says during the first puzzle.
-- You can now get a new hint each time you walk over to Marty if he isn't
talking just then.
-- If you use Pumpy on a bird she will go back to the size you give her after
flying or being removed from a box. (Favored size is currently lost when a
bird is put in a notebook and taken out.)
-- Pictures started to run when taken out of a notebook even if the power was off.
-- Improved the warning Marty gives if a robot doesn't accept a box.
-- First time a user generates a Java applet a message box appears explaining
what is happening.
-- Fixed a bug where a bird is returning to a box (perhaps on the back of a picture)
and the box has in the meanwhile been dropped on a blank page of the notebook.
-- Text and numbers can now be used to decorate the city (as well as pictures).
-- Pictures now wait a few seconds before running (if robots are on the back)
after being taken out of a notebook.
-- Robot's trained to use tools where the right button was used rather than
the space bar got confused.
-- A robot trained to use Pumpy got confused.
-- Backspace now behaves just like '-' when flipping pages in a notebook.  Old
scheme confused many.
10/16
-- Pictures have been changed. If the image on the picture is non-rectangular
you only see the image now and not the background and frame. When pointing to
and holding a picture you now see the image and the border.  The meaning of
remote control for visibility has changed so that "SEE SOME" now means if a picture
has pictures on top you see them but not the underlying picture.
-- Collision detectors now do not sense invisible objects.
-- Collision detectors on the back of pictures that are on a picture whose
visibility is "SEE SOME" now detect objects at the "level" of the picture
they are on.
-- StartTT -autodemo <n> now works even if the application is not active (but
not if it has been iconized). This is mostly useful for a "kiosk" demo mode.
-- The programmer when walking around the city can walk through pictures
(decoration) but except for rectangles (which may be invisible).
This gives flexibility in deciding now solid decorations should be. If power
is off (via F8) then programmer can walk through fine.
-- The remote control for "Picture #" (which controls the color for synthetic
pictures like ovals and rounded rectangles) used to display numbers greater
than 255.
10/17
-- Some things (like dizzy.tt in the Doc directory and puzzles 44 and 45) were saved
from the ToonTalk clipboard and couldn't be restored by version 8C or later
(due to a format change).
10/18
-- You can now see things on the floor when you stand up!!
-- And you can move around while on the floor by moving your arm off screen!
10/19
-- If ToonTalk tried to put up a message box before everything was initialized
then a different message box came up about a problem with DirectDraw.
-- Fixed various new bugs with moving around in the room.
10/20
-- If the command line contains -m 0 then no memory is devoted to caching files.
Used to be as a result sounds (like the heliocopter) kept repeating. Also some
memory leaked when the cache got too full.
-- Fixed a problem that sometimes occured when a bird flew outside.
10/21
-- Fixed a DirectDraw bug that caused ToonTalk to crash on start up in high-resolution
on some video cards.  (Thanks to Julian Pixton for his help.)
-- Fixed a problem moving around on the ground (Tooly didn't behave right.)
-- While training a robot things are now restored and you can no longer move around.
-- Speech used to go off while Marty was around but now only when Marty is talking.
if -tts_uses_ds 1 is used then both speaking and sounds work but on most test machines
there are long delays and a bad hiss.
-- The speech engine is now initialized during the credits so there isn't a long
pause before you can enter Marty's rocket when starting up the puzzle game.
10/22
-- Fixed a bug in the Swedish version that caused all demos to terminate immediately.
10/23
-- Fixed a bug where the browser was launched before the Java applet was completed.
(Still can happen on Windows 3.1 or NT 3.51 -- you'll need to do shift-reload of
Netscape if applet doesn't start.)
-- Grass is now green when you sit.
-- Improved the animation of the tree decoration.
-- Flower decoration now comes in 3 colors and also includes animation of it
browning and recovering.
-- Changed the way "the z ordering" that determines which object is in front
of others. Works better in the room and with the tool box following you.
10/24
-- Bike pump used to be hard to pick up from the top.
-- Bike pump would sometimes not settle down when released.
-- When training a robot his hand is nearly immobile.
-- When training a robot he picks things up and holds them in his hand now.
-- When training a robot it used to be that if he picked up the tool box or
the notebook he would leave them looking very small.
-- When moving around on the floor you now see the front wall if you move
forward far enough.
-- If you move around on the ground then when you stand up you have moved
appropriately.
-- Made minor improvements to the animation of Marty. 
-- When getting up from the ground only pictures, text, and numbers stay behind.
Everything else disappears (except of course Tooly and his contents).
-- Fixed a bug where if you quickly grab something before Bammer smashes it
then he'll smash it in your hand and the system crashes.
-- Camera doesn't move when hand is hidden now.  No interference with Ping Pong,
for example.
10/26
-- Sometimes ToonTalk gave up on speech engine and turned it off unnecessarily.
-- If you dropped certain things (like a bird) near a wall of the room while
on the floor it would jump towards the center.
-- When holding a bird she now is animated -- used to freeze.
10/27
-- You can now add a picture to a bird's tee shirt. Because when you give a bird
a picture she takes it to her nest, the picture must completely fit on top of the
tee shirt. Using Pumpy to expand the bird and then dropping a picture is recommended.
10/28
-- There is now a remote control for adding decoration to the wall of the room.
It looks like a picture of the wall and you drop stuff on it (or vacuum them off)
and they like voodoo appear on the wall of the house you are in.
-- Fixed a bug where sound sometimes stopped (if text-to-speech was on).
-- Fixed a bug where programmer sometimes stepped on things on the floor and
sometimes he went in front and behind them.  Now always stuff is flat on the floor.
10/29
-- Fixed a bug displaying blank picturs where sometimes they became invisible.
-- When a robot is flipping over pictures the sizes of pictures and notebooks
was wrong when viewed while standing in the room.
-- Fixed a problem that caused wall decoration to flicker and only sometimes
be clipped to the right area.
10/30
-- Fixed another bug where stuff on the wall of the room sometimes flickered.
-- Fixed more problems with puzzles and wall decoration.
-- The draw order (the "z ordering") of things that have been added to things
(like objects in a truck) was not always correct.  Meant that sometimes things
were in front of other things and somethings behind.
11/2
-- There are now 2 new remote controls. One for decorating the front of a house
and the other for decorating the roof of a house.
-- Some pictures acted as if they were much bigger than they appeared (since they
can change to that).  Also meant that when picked up they sometimes floated to
the left of your hand.
11/4
-- You can now save birds with t-shirts in notebooks.
-- Some items in notebooks didn't fill the page very well.
11/5
-- With -b 2 or more (mouse buttons shortcuts enabled), used to be that if you
pointed to the stack of bombs in the toolbox and clicked the right button the
stack of bombs would go off and crash ToonTalk.
-- You can now save and restore whole cities. Interface to this functionality needs work.
11/6
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug with houses blowing up when viewed from outside.
-- Fixed a bug with puzzle #9 (1,000,000,000) in the 16-bit version.  Thanks to
Steve Newman for reporting it.
-- Fixed a bug where if you vacuumed up a truck or box or the like just before
a robot was to drop something into it the system crashed. Thanks to
Steve Newman for reporting it.
11/7
-- ToonTalk now offers trouble-shooting advice when things go wrong.
-- Fixed a problem when watching a robot drop things on top of other things where
they were displayed sometimes as one on top of another and sometimes the other
way around.
11/12
-- Saving cities now works even if trucks are driving around, birds flying, etc.
-- The pause dialog box now gives you the option of saving your city.  Except
during puzzle game or while training a robot.
-- Saving a city now saves the programmer's location as well.
-- Fixed the geometry of things in the notebook (some were too small -- teams of
robots were too big).
11/13
-- Restored the default for -b to 1. In other words, by default any mouse button
can be used to pick up and drop. Space bar is available for using what you've picked
up.
11/14
-- Fixed some memory leaks.  Especially bad when running the sentences demo.
-- Internals are now more careful about stray references -- e.g. a bird returning
to the box she left from does not crash if the box has been destroyed in the
meanwhile.
-- Fixed a recent problem with some robot puzzles where the robot won't work
the first time.
-- Fixed a problem with clicking the close dialog when asked your name. Only
if NoName is an old user.
11/15
-- Fixed a display bug that didn't clip some things right on the wall.
Puzzles with large boxes for solutions in particular partly flickered.
-- The sensor showing the number of milliseconds since the last cycle now shows
the truth even if the system was interrupted and resumed.  Also used to be
maximum value of 1000.
-- Fixed a bug where Bammer the mouse hit his hammer half way between where
the remote control for the looks of a number was and where the number was.
-- Fixed a bug where sometimes you couldn't train a robot to drop something
from a magic wand onto something else.
11/17
-- If you save in the notebook a box that contains pictures and remote controls
then they are saved so that when retrieved from the notebook the same relationships
hold. Also when you copy a box like that then the copy has remote controls for
the copy not the original.
11/18
-- Fixed a recently introduced problem where numbers and text didn't display
well on the walls during puzzle play.
11/19
-- If you trained a robot to set off a bomb by pointing to a bomb (not holding
it) and typing space (or right mouse button if enabled) then the robot was
confused when run. You now once again must be holding a bomb to set it off.
(Thanks to Patrick J. Holmes for reporting this.)
11/20
-- Start ToonTalk now has a "Set Options" button which provides a much easier
than earlier schemes for customizing ToonTalk.
-- Fixed a bug where Marty was sometimes invisible when you were on the ground.
-- Fixed a bug where if you held something in your hand when you got up from
the ground that it became invisible.
-- Fixed a bug so that you can now save the city when you are on the ground.
-- Fixed a bug where after you got up from the ground you looked as if you were
floating on top of other things.
11/21
-- You can now double-click on a ToonTalk city file and it will launch ToonTalk
with that city.  You can also specify which city with -city <file name> on the
command line.
11/22
-- Fixed various bugs with saving and describing pictures with remote controls
on the back. (E.g. the Ping Pong example.)
-- Fixed a recent problem where if you hide your hand, the arm is still visible.
-- If options were set indicating they should apply to old users as well then
they only had an affect the first time an older user ran ToonTalk.
-- If you were holding something big and tried to move your hand to see the other
end then the "camera" would move and follow your hand.
-- Marty was getting confused describing robots.
-- A bug prevented you from returning a robot to the notebook it came from.
-- Fixed a bug the prevented you from double clicking on a puzzle file to start
up that puzzle.
-- Fixed a bug where sometimes a robot that starts off with a wand and the wand
became very big.
11/23
-- Fixed problems with the size of things the robot releases when watched while
standing in the room.
-- Robots sometimes carried things underneath themselves.
-- Robots sometimes dropped things a bit far from what they were being dropped
on.
-- Sometimes things ended up underneath the magic wand while still attached to it.
-- F3 now works during puzzles 25 and 26.
-- When Marty is speaking something that contains a parenthetical remark he
sometimes skipped part of it. Now he skips the whole thing.
-- A warning that the beta version was soon to expire interferred with running
demos.
-- Beta 9 released.
11/24
-- 16-bit version was confused about command line when options were set and
an old user name used.
-- 16-bit version could try to start in high-resolution but many things looked
wrong.
-- Object on the ground disappeared when you moved your hand enough to so that
the camera moved.
11/25
-- If you leave while Marty is talking during "Play Game" and come back he
explains that he had more to say last time but didn't say it.
-- Occassionally Marty tried to say " " and put up a little empty talk balloon.
-- When you resumed playing the game, then numbers and text pads on the wall of
the rocket were lacking the pad part -- just the characters showed.
-- Marty used to give hints when you walked over to him during puzzle play even
if it was the start of the puzzle and you haven't left the rocket since hearing
the puzzle.
-- Standing up while holding the toolbox in your hand led to confusion. Now it
is dropped automatically when standing.
-- If you turn off sound then ToonTalk no longer wastes time initializing the
text-to-speech engine.
-- Beta 9A released
11/30
-- Fixed a problem where some default settings (e.g. high resolution) interfered
with command line arguments to starttt.exe.
-- Fixed problems with starttt working with other languages.
-- Fixed a couple of minor memory leaks.
12/1
-- Fixed a problem where changes to options didn't affect old users due to the
fact that the 16-bit and 32-bit versions believed they were in different time
zones!
12/8
-- Fixed a minor memory leak.
-- Fixed a new Beta 9 bug where pictures didn't clip pictures on top right.
-- Fixed a bug where robots that stopped during a puzzle while you were outside
sometimes ended up stuck on the wall and couldn't be grabbed.
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- Fixed a bug in the saving of shared items (e.g. robots and their notebook or
birds and nests). Showed up by crashing restoring some cities or puzzle player
states. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
12/9
-- Fixed a couple more minor memory leaks.
-- Fixed a bug with generating a Java applet from ToonTalk object that contains
user pictures (made with the "File to Picture" remote control). There are still
security problems running it as an applet rather than an application.
12/10
-- If you used a user picture to decorate the roof of a house it was the wrong
size.
-- If you saved a city while flying above the city and then came back the
helicopter didn't work right.
-- If you left certain kinds of remote controls on the floor (like the decoration,
or clipboard or file to X kind) then they ended up very very narrow.
-- Updated the 32-bit upgrade on ftp.toontalk.com to include the most recent bug
fixes.  Full update coming soon.
12/11
-- Puzzles where a robot starts off holding a magic wand had the problem that
if the robot was trained to set down the wand he couldn't pick it up again.
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- If more than one natural language (e.g. English and Swedish) have been installed
on the same system then "Set Options" now gives the language choice where the
name of the language is translated appropriately.
-- Many remote controls that show pictures (like the "File to Picture") now show
a black background with a white frame.
-- The implementation of selection feedback was completely re-written. Should
avoid cases where thin white or black horizontal or vertical lines appeared when
pointing to something with certains things on top of it.
12/12
-- If while your notebook is starting to fly out of Tooly the Toolbox you call
for a tool (or press F7 to hurry things up) then sometimes the stuff on the first
2 pages of the notebook were too small.
--Fixed problems with roof remote controls where the sizes and locations of things
were off.
12/15
-- Improved the geometry of houses when viewed from above.
-- Fixed a bug in loading in some puzzles (at least #39).
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- "File to Picture" and "File to Sound" have been changed how they handle
partial file names. If there is no extension they'll add "BMP" for pictures
and "WAV" for sounds. If the file name doesn't indicate which directory then
the "Users" directory of the ToonTalk installation is used.
-- When training a robot (or when one is waiting) they aren't quite as frentic
now.
-- When a truck was driving outside and seen from the side there was a pixel
that flew over the truck sometimes.
12/16
-- Fixed a problem replaying certain demos (re-ordered some events in Queue::begin_run).
12/31
-- Fixed more bugs replaying certain demos.
1/4/98
-- Made various changes to how demos are recorded. Now supports demos recorded for
low and high resolution graphics that share the same subtitles, narration, and
name.
1/5
-- Fixed another bug in replaying demos.
-- Fixed a bug where puzzle #48 put up a dialog box suggesting you go back 5
puzzles. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- If a bird is flying to her nest and it is in your pocket then when you stood
up she froze until you sat down again.
-- Improved the wording of some of the puzzles between 42 and 48.
-- Puzzle #54 was broken.
1/7
-- Fixed a problem in puzzles where you saw extra copies of what you were pointing
to.
-- Improved the appearance of the goal in puzzle #41.
-- Replaying demos used to turn of speech. Now it does so only if the demo has
narration and the text-to-speech engine is not using DirectSound.
-- Sometimes when a bird removed things from her nest to put a new thing on the
bottom the nest would become invisible for a short while. And the size of the
new thing added to the bottom of the stack on top of the nest was the wrong size.
-- If a bird was delivering something to its nest which is in your pocket and
you are outside, then sometimes when going inside while the bird was trying to
reach you it would get stuck outside until you went out again.
-- If you dropped something on a box while something was in progress in falling
into a hole then the drop was ignore. This was true even if you were dropping
something on a different part of the box. Now only if the same hole is involved
is it ignored.
-- If a box was moved while something was falling into a hole then that item
was not displayed at the right place until the box was dropped.
1/8
-- If you saved just before doing the puzzle where you were supposed to use a
bomb then when started again the house you needed to blow up wasn't there. Now
you start again on the previous puzzle.
-- Sometimes while doing puzzles involving a stack of things on the nest ToonTalk
got mixed up and the robot would wait even though everything was fine.
-- Improved how Marty responds to wrong answers for the bomb puzzle.
-- If during puzzles you bring a bomb back to Marty he'll now explain how bombs
work.
-- Occasionally during puzzles a robot gets stuck on the wall -- fixed now.
-- If you have a nest in your pocket then sometimes while standing or sitting
and a bird was flying towards you ToonTalk would behave strangely or crash.
1/9
-- After solving puzzle #49 ToonTalk would sometimes put up a dialog box saying
you needed to go back 8 puzzles. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
1/10
-- Fixed a bug where birds flying between houses would get stuck if you entered
the house where it came from.
-- Fixed a bug replaying demos where Dusty is turned on by the right mouse button.
1/11
-- Fixed some problems supporting temporary users (indicated by -t 1 on the command line -- a user profile is not kept for them).
-- Fixed problems going from puzzle #55 to #61 (sometimes skipped to #62 and didn't save right).
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
1/12
-- Demos are now interrupted by any mouse click.
-- Subtitles continued even if you took control of a demo.
-- Fixed a bug in -autodemo <n> which is for museum or store use.
-- Gave out 9 CDROM to Mrs. Colton's class
1/13
-- Fixed a problem with the end of the new exploding houses demo in low res.
1/15
-- Fixed various problems that sometimes caused subtitles of demos to stay up
too briefly or long.
-- Fixed a bug that broke the remote controls for a picture that were yes/no
answers to questions.
1/16
-- Fixed problems with puzzle #63 and following.
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
1/19
-- Fixed a memory problem with the destruction of pictures that have been flipped
twice.
1/20
-- On slow machines the subtitles appeared too early.
-- When running in a window (not full-screen) and moving the mouse wildly the
system mistook this for a problem and offered inappropriate trouble shooting.
-- When tossing a picture on another picture (by holding down the control button),
the picture underneath acted as if the user hit the space bar and changed
appearance or color.
-- Passed out the other 8 CDROMs in class.
-- Fixed a fairly recent bug that broke the remote control for the looks of a picture.
-- If you dropped a number of the remote control for that number's looks (obtained by flipping it over) then
ToonTalk crashed.
1/21
-- Fixed a display bug where if you pointed to a robot or truck you sometimes
saw "ghosts" of old items.
-- Finished updating all the demos. They now work better and in both high and low resolution.
-- Fixed a bug that caused the system to be unstable after solving a level.
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this and helping track it down.)
1/22
-- Sometimes after solving puzzle #61 ToonTalk would say you have to go back
a puzzle and then send you forward instead. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- Sometimes when numbers and remote controls for how something looks were added then Bammer the Mouse would hit is hammer at the wrong place.
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- If you dropped some text on some text and then dropped more before Bammer came then letters were lost.
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
1/23
-- If a demo was paused while the programmer was holding something a Java applet was generared and run.
-- Demo files now record which puzzle file (if any) the demo started from.
-- Occassionally ToonTalk generated very large <user name>.log files. These are now limitted to 100 lines (except for the debugging version of ToonTalk). (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- Beta 10 released on the Internet.
-- A magic wand out of magic now only makes a "failure" sound if it is on the screen. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for suggesting this.)
-- Fixed a bug in saving a room to the clipboard via F6 (used in making puzzles).
-- Puzzle #16 had a text pad with A on it on the side for no reason.
-- Puzzle #5 had Dusty underneath some junk.
1/26
-- Fixed a bug that caused the 16-bit version to stop replaying a demo if flying
above a city with trucks driving around. (This broke the exploding houses demo.)
1/27
-- Fixed the low resolution version of part 2 of the Ping Pong demo.
1/28
-- Demos now run in a window if a user has chosen that option in "Set Options".
-- If you use "Set Options" to indicate "museum mode" then it takes effect
immediately (rather than the way it was which was next time you start ToonTalk).
-- Changed the Swedish version so it runs older versions of the demos which have
synchronized narration.
1/29
-- Removed the minimize and maximize buttons from the dialog asking your name.
(Thanks to Oliver Gerards for pointing this out.)
-- Shrunk the size of the "Loading from CDROM" message (thanks to a suggestion
from Shelly C. Wallace).
-- Used to be that if you held down space then the system autorepeat would
cause ToonTalk to act like you pressed it multiple times.  No longer. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- Running a demo no longer changes the default name in the dialog that asks your name. (Thanks to Oliver Gerards for pointing this out.)
-- If you picked up a box inside of a box, stood up, sat down, and dropped something into the inner box the system crashed.
1/30
-- Fixed a problem with remote controls of the appearance of a number where the width the number would change rapidly if the number changed its number of digits.
-- Fixed a problem where if you typed to a number with robots on the back, the number wouldn't look like it changed until you picked it up.
-- The 16-bit version can now be exited by typing Alt-F4.
-- Fixed a bug that broke puzzle #64 and a few afterwards.
-- Fixed a bug where certain kinds of pictures ended up at the wrong place on the floor after saving and restoring a city.
-- Fixed a bug where sometimes if you come back to doing puzzles after having done free play something that was supposed to be in your hand wasn't.
-- If you saved a room (say to make a puzzle) then sometimes when the room was restored things that were on top of other things were now underneath.
(This caused puzzle #5 to be solvable without using Dusty as intended.)
-- In puzzle mode (but not free play) it was possible to lose something just off the edge of the screen. Your hand can now
reach further in all four directions.
-- If Pumpy is used to make something a good size ('G') then you sometimes got the wrong sound effect and it would happen instantly rather than be animated.
-- If you were running the 16 bit version in full-screen mode and some other program got the focus (e.g. you typed Alt-Tab) then when ToonTalk was resumed it was in a Window rather than full-screen.
-- Sometimes boxes with lots of holes had very narow see through gaps.
1/31
-- Numbers no longer act like they are selected when first typed to. They now behave like text pads do to typing.
-- If a puzzle had a robot with a training counter then used to be after it went to zero you could still training it to do
more if you quickly did another action.
-- The display of the number of steps left for training a robot in puzzle mode improved.
-- Pressing F1 while walking outside will now call for the helicopter (as well as 'h' and 'H' as before).
-- Sometimes when training a robot to give a bird something the bird would fly off with the item but drop it in view (if the item was wide enough).
-- If you try to pick up a tool that a robot is holding you know grasp the robot.
-- The placement of solutions was wrong for user defined puzzles.
-- The geometry of things put on the wall using the wall decoration remote was broken.
-- The "Back" button on "Set Options" did work on the last page (unless more than 1 language version was installed). (Thanks to Oliver Gerards for pointing this out.)
-- Fixed a problem where Marty showed www.toontalk and left off the .com part. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- If you walk into the house after solving the last puzzle it now says "Thanks".  (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting the old behavior.)
-- If you paused a demo and then it lost focus (e.g. a screen saver started running) then ToonTalk would iconize which is OK but it wouldn't start again.
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- Puzzle #48 had a recently introduced bug so that the timer remote showed "no".
(Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
2/1
-- If you quit on the first puzzle or on the first two robot puzzles you are now offered to see hint files.
-- If you paused while holding a scale, ToonTalk used to try to generate a Java applet of the scale.
-- Improved the appearance of number and text pads by halfing the darker colored part between characters.
-- If you create something with user pictures and then generate a Java applet if a file of the same name but which is a GIF file rather than a BMP file exists on the Java subdirectory then it'll be used instead.
This fixes the problem that applets can't deal with BMP files (while Java applications can).
-- Similarly user sounds used in Java applets will use AU rather than WAV files if found.
2/3
-- In puzzle mode sometimes when a robot failed it would make a failing noise even when you were outside. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- Java applets were no longer making sound effects.
-- User defined sound effects sometimes caused the system to crash.
-- The label on the roof, house, and wall decorations in the sensor notebook were wrong.
2/4
-- Fixed problems with pausing and resuming ToonTalk. (When Windows has more than 256 colors and the 16-bit version
and interactions with screen-savers.)
-- 16 bit version showing a demo in full-screen when interrupted by another program (or Alt-Tab) then when
resumed was no longer full-screen.
-- Interrupting a demo and then resuming made the mouse cursor visible.
2/5
-- 16 bit version looked terrible when power was turned off (F8) and running with Windows with other than 256
colors.
-- 16 bit version would try to read from the CDROM even if everything was installed on hard drive.
-- Both versions tried to read from CDROM to try to run a demo that didn't exist.
-- Start ToonTalk displayed the buttons in an ugly manner when Windows was running in with large fonts.
-- If you haven't used ToonTalk for a while you got an offer to reset Marty's user model even if you were just
playing the puzzle game.
2/6
-- Sometimes when restarting a puzzle (with a bomb) you lost what was in your hand.
-- Sometimes inside the rocket a solution was posted over the door rather than in a good slot.
-- In the alarm clock puzzle if you brought any empty nest but then the bird never delievered the nest was posted on the wall anyway.
-- Fixed the placement of Dusty in puzzle 64 (was very near the top).  (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- Sometimes a robot would wait on box just off the top of the screen. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)
-- Marty would crash trying to describe something it knew nothing about. Now he says nothing.
2/23
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug (on 1/31) where if you ran a puzzle where a robot started off holding a wand then it needed to be holding the wand at the end of training. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace and Marc for reporting this.)
-- Provided support for -language British (including proper handling of large numbers and speaking them).

3/23
-- The warning for trouble shooting joystick calibration would cause ToonTalk to pause and resume when flying to the edge of the city.
-- Sometimes ToonTalk started up without acquiring the mouse so that mouse movement was ignored until ToonTalk was paused and resumed.
-- Added a force effect to puzzle game if you try to enter the house without having been in the rocket.

3/26
-- Fixed a memory leak when putting pictures into a notebook if the pictures had been flipped over.
-- Sometimes the system would generate warnings on start up that would end up spoken by Marty during credits. A message box is now used.
-- Fixed a memory leak associated with the collision remote control/sensor.
3/27

-- A few puzzles, if restarted by setting off the bomb, restored the house without all the things needed on the floor. 
3/31
-- Improved the timing of subtitles and introduced a toontalk.ini Switch "SubtitlesSpeed" which controls the speed. 100 is normal.
-- Introduced another toontalk.ini Switch "MaximumNumberOfHoles" which controls the maximum number of holes a box can have. 2,048 is the default.
4/1

4/3
-- Fixed a color palette problem when running on a display using more than 256 colors and you are not

4/8
-- Installation from CDROM to a machine without a web browser didn't completely install things if user chose to install Internet Explorer.
4/9
-- The text-to-speech engine is not set at maximum volume. Previously on some systems it was barely audible.
-- Sometimes when you take things out of the notebook (like trucks) then the stuff inside became invisible.
-- The new handling of multi-line text broke the random sentence maker examples.
-- Fixed internal bookkeepping problem when sitting down while a robot is about to pick up something.
-- Fixed a display bug where sometimes you see parts of where an object was for a few seconds. (This occured only when subtitles were visible.)
4/10
-- Fixed a bug in the display of drop feedback on boxes (just the appropriate part of the box wiggles).
-- During the puzzle game robots did not clean up after themselves as they do in free play. Thanks to Shelley Wallace for reporting this.
-- If you took a remote control for the looks of something into another house and robots were dropping things on the original, then you could hear the mouse's hammer and it was slow.
-- If you dropped something on a text pad and then dropped something else before the mouse came you got an empty text pad. Thanks to Shelley Wallace for reporting this.
-- The puzzle about binary numbers now uses commas (for the American version) to seperate every 3 digits. This way the number pad matches the picture on the wall and Marty's talk balloon. Thanks to Shelley Wallace for reporting this.
4/11
-- Fixed problems with the remote control for looks not working right if in a different house from its "controlee".
4/12
-- Discovered a bug in the Microsoft Visual C++ ifstream class library which caused Marty to give very little advice during Free Play. (Switched back to Borland C++ for now.) [Turn out the default for open regarding ios::nocreate was the issue.]
-- Redid the low resolution version of the bank account demo.
4/14
-- Released Beta 11A
-- Added 2 buttons to the choose demo screen: Help and Set Options. Like the previous screen.
-- If a language was specified using -language name then trailing spaces sometimes confused it.
4/15

-- Finished generating a British version of ToonTalk -- with different narration, spelling, printing and speaking numbers, and the like.
-- Fixed a bug with trouble shooting certain problems like un-installed file extensions.
-- Fixed the problem that the low resolution version of the Swap demo ran in high resolution in 32-bit version.
4/28
-- Improved the description of puzzle 42. (Thanks to Ivan Filippenko for pointing out this out.)
-- Fixed a sentence in the final hint of puzzle 32. Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for pointing this out.
4/29
-- British version no longer says "Howdy".
-- Fixed a bug where if a robot started off with a tool (as in many puzzles) and set it down and then picked it up he got a new version of the tool. And if a wand then copy counter was gone.
-- If you closed the dialog box asking for your name then sometimes the next time you ran ToonTalk it offered trouble shooting advice claiming incorrectly that ToonTalk didn't terminate properly last time. Thanks to Shelley Wallace for help with this.
-- In the UK version Marty said numbers incorrectly if they contained commas.
-- In the UK version commas are now optional in numbers that are coming from the clipboard to become a number pad.  
-- Puzzle 19 was broken in languages that don't have commas inside of large numbers.
-- UK puzzles no longer have numbers with commas in them.
4/30
-- Cleaned up the second splash screen (where Marty says the credits) and some of the images when the helicopter is landing.
-- If you dropped a box on a blank number pad, the pad correctly changed to the number of holes of the box. Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for reporting this. Also the blank number became non-blank before the mouse smashed it.
-- If you trained a robot to drop something on a blank box, the robot got confused. Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for reporting this.
-- If you trained a robot to push buttons of a tool, the robot got confused. Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for reporting this.

-- There was no drop feedback if something was attached to the wand.
-- Made several improvements to drop feedback.
-- Occassionally you could copy something with a wand and then it went other items on the floor when moved around while still attached to wand.
5/1
-- You can now drop numbers on remote controls that have a list of values (e.g. "yes" and "no" or "see some", "see all", and "see nothing").
-- UK version was adding spurious warnings about missing strings to log files.
-- If while a bird was moving the stack of things off her nest to put a new item on the bottom, you grabbed the item, or stack, or the nest confusion could follow. No longer grabable while bird is moving things around.
-- If while Marty was speaking and using talk balloons you pressed PageDown many times, Marty would sometimes show an empty balloon for a while. Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.
-- Start ToonTalk now has a button for an "about" box (to keep lawyers happy).
-- When you pause ToonTalk while Marty is speaking, he know stops mid-sentence. Narration too.
-- UK CDROM version read from CDROM even when it didn't need to.
-- If you double click on a USR file, you now get a choice of Free Play, Game, or Demos. Previously jumped to Free Play.
5/3
-- Made the text for puzzle #8 less ambiguous.
-- If you try to train a robot to give a box to another robot, Marty said you can't train a robot to train a robot. Now if that robot is already trained, Marty says you can't train a robot to give a box to a robot.
5/5
-- Fixed a bug that sometimes crashed the system when flipping through the sensor notebook.
-- Vacuuming up and then spitting out a picture broke remote controls for the picture.
-- The remote control for showing what a picture is colliding with didn't work for user defined pictures.
5/11
-- UK version now speaks numbers correctly.
-- Fixed a bug where a saved city sometimes lost the connection between a sensor and a picture.
-- If you called for a tool (e.g. F2 for Dusty) and then picked up something before Dusty jumped into your hand, Dusty got confused.
-- If you trained a robot on a box containing the sensor for "who is colliding" with a picture, then the thought bubble was wrong and matching didn't work right.
-- Trial version no longer lets you save notebooks or cities. Sorry.
-- Fixed a bug in generating Java code dealing with user provided images or sounds.
5/12
-- UK version had a bug speaking numbers with commas in them.
-- Puzzle 31 now asks for day followed by month except for the US version.
5/13
-- Sometimes when certain items (like nests and scales) in boxes became very small, then when the box became big the items were so small they couldn't be seen. (But they could be picked up.) Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for helping track this down.
-- If a picture on a picture became very small and then was copied the geometry was lost and sometimes the pictures on the pictures became too small to see. Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for helping track this down.
5/14
-- Fixed a bug introduced on May 5, which causes the system to crash if a collision detector is used while something is destroyed (e.g. dropped in the notebook). Ping Pong Act 2 demo crashed.
-- When you copied something that was a part of something, the copy sometimes had an odd size. Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for pointing this out.
-- Fixed a bug in puzzles where sometimes a robot's wand got a very strange size.
-- If during the puzzle game, you stand up while a robot is working, then Dusty did not appear if needed.
-- If during the puzzle game, a robot fails and there is another team member behind him, then Dusty appeared even if not needed.
-- If during the puzzle game and Dusty is running to your hand, then Dusty now stops if you pick up something before he jumps in your hand.
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug where if a bird while a bird in another house adds something to the stack of stuff on her nest, that the item appears in house you are in.
-- Marty sometimes with text-to-speech would only say the part of a sentence after a comma.
-- Marty would leave while saying "bye" or "so long" and it would be cut off.
-- Marty sometimes would say "hello" at inappropriate times.
-- Closing the dialog box that asks if you want to continue, come back later, etc. now acts just like choosing continue. 
5/15
-- A totering scale now matches a totering scale. Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for pointing this out.
-- Bammer the Mouse now joins boxes together -- previously they just clicked together instantly. Thanks to the folk at the Institute of Education at the University of London for suggesting this.
-- If a robot was trained to make a team out of other robots it got confused.
-- If a robot was trained to put a box into the thought bubble of another trained robot, he got confused.
-- If a trained robot's box was removed from his thought bubble then that robot was not saved correctly (in the notebook or a city).
-- Bammer the Mouse now joins robots together to make teams. Thanks to the folk at the Institute of Education at the University of London for suggesting this.
-- On the first puzzle on a level the sound for having a good solution wasn't played even if it was the first puzzle solved in the session. Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for pointing this out.
5/18
-- If Dusty or Pumpy was running into your hand while you stood up then when you sat down, he looked funny in your hand until you dropped him.
-- If a bird was delivering something to a nest and a robot was removing things from the nest and you were watching standing up then sometimes ToonTalk crashed. Sometimes this happened in puzzle #48. Thanks to Sven Huberti for reporting this.
-- If you pick up something before Bammer the Mouse smashes it then both items move together until smashed together.
-- Sometimes after Marty gave the final hint for a puzzle, if you came back to him he would present an empty talk balloon.
-- Sometimes things didn't quite fix in a boxes hole -- but where a little bit too big or small. Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for pointing this out. 
-- If a robot was trained to have Dusty spit something out, then it got confused when you tried to pick up the thing spit out.
-- If a robot was trained to use Dusty and left stuff on the floor and left Dusty in reverse or "erase" mode then the robot was confused when run.
-- If a robot was trained to flip a picture over the geometry of the flipped picture was that of the other side.
5/19
-- If a robot was trained to use Dusty, set him down, and then use him again the second time Dusty was too big and not positioned right.
-- You can now add a bird to the back of a picture. This is useful in conjunction with the sensor which shows who you are colliding with. 
You can vacuum off the picture from the sensor, flip it over, get the bird, and give it a message. This is great for advanced game and simulation programming.
5/21
-- Marty can now talk about robots that are trained to manipulate the thought bubbles of other robots.
-- If you were holding a robot over another robot and then call for Marty, he used to describe the robot underneath -- not the one you are holding.
-- Sometimes while Marty is talking and you send him away (with F1), he displays some old thing he had said for a few seconds before leaving.
-- If you saved a city with a bird or nest whose other part was in Dusty the vacuum, then when loading the city the bird or nest was created with unknown counterparts. They now create the missing part when released.
-- If you dropped anything other than a text or number pad on a blank box, Marty repeatedly gave a somewhat inappropriate warning.
-- Blank robots are now supported. Good for putting in a boxes in thought bubbles.
-- If you drop a team of robots on a blank number pad, it now gets the number of robots in the team.
-- If you drop a team of robots on a blank box, it now gets one robot per hole.
5/22
-- In the UK version, Marty had troubles describing which special keys (like rubout) are pressed by a robot.
-- In the UK version, Marty had troubles saying "backspace" (not says "backspace key" and all is well).
-- Marty sometimes said things like "And then pick up a text." now says "And then pick up a text pad."
-- Sometimes if Marty teleports in when the last place he was has blown up the system crashed.
5/23
-- The recursive factorial sample program was broken (doc/English/programs.htm). The doubly recursive factorial has yet to be fixed but a work around in now documented in the dfact.tt file. Thanks to Carl R. Witty for reporting this problem.
-- Took away the "quit" button on the choose demo screen. (Made it too long for 640x480 screens with task bar.)
-- If you trained a robot to set off a bomb and then run that robot on the back of a picture that you are holding, sometimes ToonTalk would crash. Thanks to Carl R. Witty for reporting this problem.
-- Beta 12 released on the Internet
5/24
-- If you saved a city while a picture was flipped over, then when you restored the city the picture's notebook was no longer connected to the picture.
5/26
-- If you dropped a number on a blank number it sometimes added and sometimes the blank number got the value of the one on top. Now it always gets the value on top.
-- If you dropped a text pad on a blank text pad, the blank text pad would turn non-blank a second before getting the value of the other.
-- If you dropped a text pad on a blank text pad, the text pad on top was destroyed after being smashed. But that wasn't consistent with other uses of blank items underneath.
-- Sometimes Bammer the Mouse would wait 1 second before starting to run out.
-- Robots sometimes got confused when trained to drop things on blank things.
5/27
-- Sometimes when a bird was adding things to a nest while a robot was removing things, ToonTalk crashed. Thanks to Sven Huberti for reporting this problem.
-- Sometimes if you pick something up just before a robot was about to then ToonTalk got mixed up. Thanks to Sven Huberti for reporting this problem. 
-- Some puzzles Marty would say "we need a number greater than X" when he should have been saying "we need a number less than Y".
-- If you saved in a notebook a nest with many thousands of items, it was not always saved correctly. Now the limit is 1000 items. Thanks to Kevin O'Brien for reporting this.
-- If you saved something in a notebook that took over 30,000 bytes to encode there were problems. Now the limit is 64K and it recovers better when the limit is exceeded. Thanks to Kevin O'Brien for reporting this.
-- If you took out options like ToonTalk's speed, or Marty's letter size, or Marty's talking speed and tried to rub them out to type a new value they would not accept 0 as a value but would jump to 100.  Thanks to Benedikt Schmitt for reporting this.
-- Very large and zero size values of ToonTalk's speed, or Marty's letter size, or Marty's talking speed now work better.
-- If you finished all the puzzles and then restart ToonTlak, then it asks you if you want to redo all the puzzles. If you said yes it got confused. Thanks to David Kahn for discovering this.
-- If an anomoly repeated happened before ToonTalk was initialized then you got repeated message boxes about it. Now the limit is 4.
5/28
-- Marty says "+, -, or space bar" as "plus or space bar". Now he says "'+', '-', or space bar" and reads it as "plus minus or space bar".
-- If you drop a sensor with a picture on it on a blank picture the blank picture gets the appearance of the remote control (but isn't active). This is like dropping a numerical sensor on a zero.
-- Overhauled some of the error reporting. Some errors would cause Marty to appear but he would spell the message since he couldn't say the words.
-- If anything important is in the user log and the user has indicated in the "Set Options" that they are "knowledgable users" then when they quit a dialog box appears offering to show them the log.
-- Fixed a problem when saving a city where some things got lost (e.g. sometimes when a picture was flipped over when saved).
-- Fixed a problem trying to read non-existent files when compiled with Microsoft VC++.
-- Fixed a problem that prevented offering help when quitting on the first puzzle or first robot puzzle.
5/29
-- Fixed a problem where sometimes the message saying that the beta or trial version has expired didn't appear.
6/1
-- Fixed a few problems with trouble shooting dialogs not appearing.
-- The new dialog offering to show user their log file was sometimes buried under other windows.
-- Marty had problems talking about variable width text pads (used for labels in notebooks).
-- Fixed a problem where a box held by a robot kept getting wider.
6/3
-- You can now retrain robots. If you vacuum out the box from a robot's thought bubble and give a box to the robot you'll re-enter his thoughts. He'll do what he was trained to do until you press a mouse or keyboard button.
-- Fixed a problem where sometimes a nest was shared accross 2 loadings (from a file or a notebook).
-- Marty used to say "0." as "zero point".
-- Fixed a problem in the UK and Swedish version where "1, 2, 3," was said wrong.
-- Sometimes the dialog box offering to show log file appeared even if Set Options was used to select inexperienced users who shouldn't be bothered.
6/4
-- If you selected the option that Marty shouldn't speak and that text balloons should stay up until you click, they zoomed by very quickly.
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug that interfered with the Fibonacci demo.
-- Trial version didn't put up box saying that it will expire in n days.
-- Trial version put up a dialog box when you tried to save something in your notebook but it was sometimes buried under other windows.
-- The variable width text pads (used in labels in the notebook) did not respond to the remote controls for "see some" vs "see all" and for text color.
6/5
-- The ToonTalk memory cache had a maximum size of 25% of physical memory. It now is 25% of the smaller of physical memory and available virtual memory.
-- If toontalk.ini has an entry DefaultUser=X then new users will get the default city, notebook, and tool layout of user X. (Wasn't documented and city aspect not implemented previously.)
-- Occassionally the system crashed after sitting down after having stood up from the grass.
-- Saving a city when sitting on the ground produced a city that couldn't be loaded properly.
-- Remote controls for decorating the room, house, or roof behaved badly if you are on the ground.
6/6
-- Fixed a memory leak when the vacuum was used while training a robot.
-- Fixed a memory leak when a robot was trained to give a bird something.
6/7
-- Due to a fix on 6/4 when a t-shirt of a bird was text it had a white background. 
-- You couldn't return a picture to a stack by dropping it on the stack.
-- Sometimes when something was selected, some part of it would get a white border around it.
-- Fixed a problem where Marty would cause very long delays in describing some foreign birds.
-- Fixed a problem where Marty would repeat himself after describing a foreign bird.
-- If there was an error loading a city, then the message appeared in the credits.
-- If there was an error creating a foreign bird while loading a city, then text-to-speech was turned off.
6/8
-- Fixed 2 minor memory leaks in the puzzle game.
6/9
-- The autoplay program on the CDROM mistakenly thought ToonTalk was not installed when it had been installed with the "Compact" option.
-- Marty would sometimes when saying lots of things, cut a sentence short (start next sentence after 2 seconds).
6/10
-- Sometimes the system mouse cursor would be visible while ToonTalk was running.
-- Fixed bugs in retraining a robot to return things to a stack.
-- Fixed a problem retraining a robot to add a label to a box.
-- Sometimes if a bird was returning to a house that has been blown up the system crashed.
-- Fixed bugs in retraining a robot to drop things in a truck.
-- Fixed bugs in retraining a robot to give things to a bird.
-- Fixed bugs in retraining a robot to find things in notebooks.
-- Sometimes quiting ToonTalk while training a robot crashed the system.
-- Fixed a memory leak when dealing with old robots (created before they had serial numbers). Also serial numbers were generated incorrectly for old robots.
-- Sometimes a robot trained to take something from a notebook, when running would take a page from the opposite side of the book.
-- Robots being retrained who dropped things on a notebook got confused.
-- Sometimes if a robot is being trained to use the vaccuum, it crashed when you were finished training him.
6/11
-- Fixed the sample programs primes.tt and dfact.tt (available from programs.htm).
-- The factorial demo's narration stopped in the middle of the last sentence. (Thanks to Shelly Wallace for pointing this out.)
-- The factorial demo's last sentence had the subtitles stay up much too briefly. Still goes away before sentence is over. (Thanks to Shelly Wallace for pointing this out.)
6/12
-- Fixed a recently introduced bug where in puzzles the connection between birds and nests was broken. So nests had eggs in them. (Thanks to Shelly Wallace for pointing this out.)
-- Fixed many bugs in retraining robots within puzzles.
-- After each retraining a robot got taller and thinner. No longer.
-- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the system to crash during shut down while retraining.
-- If you blew up the wrong house in puzzle 49, then you found a very large number in your hand when you re-entered the house. (Thanks to Shelly Wallace for reporting this.)
-- Puzzle 49 (the one that introduces bombs) no longer posts anything when you blow up the other house. (Thanks to Shelly Wallace for pointing this out.)
-- Fixed a problem with the autoplay executables (clickme.exe and just32.exe) had lanuching ToonTalk when ToonTalk has been un-installed. Now offers to re-install instead.
-- If text-to-speech was installed but narrations were not then demos had speech which sometimes made them terminate early.
-- Some exceptional conditions displayed dialog boxes that on the 16-bit version and a 640x480 were partly off the screen.
-- If running the 32-bit version with an 8-bit sound card, then the text-to-speech engine fails to start. It now offers trouble shooting advice for how to fix this.
-- If you flipped over a picture with a picture on top you got a confusing warning from Marty and the remote control notebook wasn't quite right.
-- If you dropped a picture on a picture then it was displayed clipped to the region of the picture underneath before Bammer smashed it.
-- If you move the ToonTalk window (not running full-screen) it now displays properly. You can also re-shape the Window. Alt-space puts up the menu.
6/13
-- When you flip over a picture with a picture on top, the end of the notebook of remote controls has a notebook for each "sub-picture". If you took one of those notebooks and dropped it back where it came from ToonTalk crashed.
-- Sometimes the notebooks at the end of the remote control notebook was missing the last ordinary remote control and label. This also confused the sub-picture notebooks.
6/14
-- If a picture had multiple things moving on top of it and some of those pictures had parts as well, then sometimes pictures would slide between another picture and its parts.
-- If a picture was moving slowly on another picture then pointing to the picture or making it move on the floor made the moving picture stop due to round off errors. The fix for this means that pictures several times larger than the screen might look wrong.
-- Sometimes when Marty was describing a remote control for the looks of something else, he started speaking nonsense.
6/15
-- Occassionally notebooks containing robots (and that weren't open to page 1) when saved in the main notebook, caused the system the crash when they were reconstructed next time. (Thanks to Kevin O'Brien for his help tracking this down.)
-- Fixed a bug in the generation of comments in Java code for describing what had just been constructed.
-- Generation of Java code was sometimes broken when birds and nests were involved. (E.g. Ping Pong game didn't translate right.)
-- If power is off (e.g. via F8) then flipping a picture with robots on the back over and then over again started the robots running.
-- Improved the geometry of large boxes where sometimes the contents weren't displayed at quite the right place.
-- Changed puzzle 31 so Marty says "Try to make a box with your birthday in it." rather than "Trying making a box with your birthday in it."
6/16
-- Re-did the end of the Ping Pong demos (parts 2 and 3).
-- Fixed a problem saving robots if they have been taken out of a notebook that is in the main notebook.
6/17
-- Fixed a problem with robots on the back of pictures that are on the back of other pictures.
-- You used to see birds fly out of a picture to another spot on the back of a picture if you dropped the picture in a box.
-- Fixed a problem dropping pictures with robots on the back on the clipboard -- sometimes it was unncessarily too large to save.
-- The largest encoding for saving an object on the clipboard is doubled. (64K before custom uuencoding).
-- The debugging version gave a spurious warning if you pressed Esc during the titles.
-- Removed the faulty dizzy sample program from programs.htm and javademo.htm and replaced it with nicer movies program.
-- Fixed Swedish version to run old demos for the ones with "old" narration.
7/4

7/6
-- If text-to-speech was not installed, then the 32-bit version reported problems starting text-to-speech in the log.
-- 16 bit Beta 13 released to the Internet.
-- Remote controls whose appearance is non-numerical sometimes had a display bug where the remote would drift around.
-- 32 bit Beta 13 released to the Internet.
7/7
-- Fixed 2 bugs when generating a Java applet of a ToonTalk picture that is or contains a picture of the programmer walking wearing a hat. Yes, the bugs were that specific.
7/9
-- Sometimes when running with Windows more than 256 colors when ToonTalk terminated it left Direct Draw is an inconsistent state so you needed to restart the computer to run ToonTalk again.
-- Fixed a problem on some web browsers running ToonTalk's java demos.
-- Revised puzzles 47 and 48 so they work fine if a correct but unexpected solution was presented in puzzle 43.
-- Fixed a problem saving to the clipboard the contents of the floor of a room (via F6) where birds and nests lost their connection.
-- Fixed a problem with the US version that it warned that narration wasn't installed when it was.
7/10
-- Fixed a bug in describing robots in notebooks. This also occurred in some situations when generating Java applets.
-- Fixed a bug in producing Java applets where a robot used a vacuum in reverse.
-- Revised the internal working of the sensor which shows who you are colliding with so that if the "collidee" has stuff on the back it is not copied until the picture is vacuumed off the sensor.
-- If you walked out during the alarm clock puzzle (#54), the system would crash. Thanks to Tyler Breisacher for reporting this and helping to track it down.

-- Fixed a bug showing trouble shooting help when the text-to-speech engine wouldn't initialize properly.
-- Fixed a bug in generating Java for a robot that vacuums something off of a sensor with a picture on it (e.g. "colliding with who").
-- Can now generate Java for a robot that flips over pictures and takes a bird off the back. (Important when used with "colliding with who").
-- Colliding with who now translates to Java so that you can take off the "collidee" and flip it over.
-- If you pressed Escape while retraining a robot, then the training stopped. Now just the retraining. You need to press Escape twice to stop both.
-- If you were training a robot with an initial tool (like the wand in many of the puzzles) and you left junk on the floor, then the robot would automatically add to his training the vacuuming of stuff left behind but would forget about the initial tool. Thanks to Tyler Breisacher for helping to track this down.

-- If while running a demo and the power saving feature (at least of Windows 98) shut down power to the display, then when resumed it stopped with DirectDraw errors.
7/14
-- If you start ToonTalk with a different user name, while another ToonTalk was running (but iconized) then ToonTalk thought you needed trouble shooting for a previous crash.
-- If you typed Alt-F4 during some puzzles, then the 32-bit version of ToonTalk would sometimes put up a DirectX error message and quit. (Pause then Quit worked fine.)
7/17
-- Released Beta 13A on the Internet
-- If you took control of some demos then the geometry of things were broken until they were resized.
7/21
-- Fixed a bug when typing Alt-F4 to the opening screen.
-- On some machines when Marty was speaking without speech bubbles, he would repeat himself over and over again.
7/29
-- If you double clicked on the file with your user profile (your USR file) then if you chose to play the puzzle game, it would ask for your name.
-- If you double clicked on a demo file (DMO) then it ran but unless the narration and/or subtitles were in the same directory they were ignored. Now it checks the ToonTalk demos directory before giving up on narration and subtitles.
7/30
-- If a city or notebook file was corrupted then ToonTalk would often crash. It now puts up a dialog box and tries to proceed. Thanks to Tyler and Lee Breisacher for their help here.
7/31
-- If a city was made size 1 (just one block) then the helicopter flew funny. Thanks to Joe Pixton for pointing this out.
-- Updated the 4 Swedish narrations for demos.
8/2
-- Fixed a bug saving a robot whose thought bubble contains a blank (i.e. erased) robot.
-- When you copied a blank robot the copy was not blank.
-- Sometimes when many trucks were driving around in a city some drove off into the water or through houses. Thanks to Joe Pixton for pointing this out.
8/5
-- In the Swedish trial version when you tried to save a city changed the label of the button the text of the label was too long.
