SUMMARY
=======
 
At the heart of owner-draw controls is the processing of WM_DRAWITEM
messages. A WM_DRAWITEM message is generated in response to an action by
the user. When an application processes this message, it paints a button, a
menu, a list box item, or a combo box item. The application must perform
the drawing of the specified control or item because the application is
free to give the control any appearance; Windows does not interfere in the
processing of owner-draw controls.
 
ODLIST is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that contains a sample
application that demonstrates processing the WM_DRAWITEM message.
 
NOTE: This sample is applicable to Windows 3.1 only, NOT to Win32.

MORE INFORMATION
================
 
The lParam that accompanies the WM_DRAWITEM message is a long (or far)
segment:offset pointer to a DRAWITEMSTRUCT data structure. For convenience
in accessing the members of the structure, the lParam is usually assigned
to a LPDRAWITEMSTRUCT variable called "lpdis" as in the following example:
 
   ...
   LPDRAWITEMSTRUCT lpdis;
   ...
   switch (message)
      {
   case WM_DRAWITEM:
      lpdis = (LPDRAWITEMSTRUCT)lParam;
   ...
 
After handling the WM_DRAWITEM message, Windows can move the
DRAWITEMSTRUCT in memory. This movement may occur even if the
application's code and data segments are FIXED. Therefore, do not keep
and reuse the value of the lpdis variable to process later WM_DRAWITEM
messages, because the far pointer may no longer be valid. Each
WM_DRAWITEM message will be accompanied by a valid lParam, which the
application should use.
 
An owner-draw control can be created as the child of a dialog box or of a
pop-up or overlapped window. The parent dialog box or window procedure will
receive a separate WM_DRAWITEM message for each owner- draw button and for
each visible item in other controls. This message is sent under any of the
following four circumstances:
 
1. When each item is first drawn
 
2. When each item is redrawn
 
3. When each item's selection state changes (selected or deselected)
 
4. When each item's focus state changes (receives or loses the focus)
 
For a list box with numerous visible items, Windows will send a substantial
number of WM_DRAWITEM messages. Therefore, it is good practice to be as
time efficient as possible when processing these messages.
 
During the processing of a WM_DRAWITEM message, be careful not to call a
function such as MessageBox() that might draw over the control. Violating
this caution may cause Windows to become unstable.
 
The members of the DRAWITEMSTRUCT data structure, documented on pages 7-36
to 7-38 of the "Microsoft Windows SDK Programmer's Reference Volume 2,"
indicate which item in which control should be drawn, and what the status
of that item is. Generally, a control item is drawn differently when it has
the focus, or when it is selected, than when it has neither of these
attributes.
 
Application code should be prepared to perform three actions. The
"itemAction" field of the DRAWITEMSTRUCT indicates the proper action to
take. The values of the itemAction field are as follows:
 
   Value             Description
   -----             -----------
 
   ODA_FOCUS         The item's focus state has changed (gained or lost
                     the focus) since it was last drawn.
 
   ODA_SELECT        The item's selection state has changed (selected or
                     unselected) since it was last drawn.
 
   ODA_DRAWENTIRE    The item has not been changed. This is a request to
                     the application to redraw the item without
                     change. The "itemState" bits, described below,
                     specify the attributes that the item should have.
 
In addition to the three actions above, there are several states in which
each control may exist. These states are indicated by the "itemState" field
of the DRAWITEMSTRUCT. The two states discussed here are the most typical
and are the only states discussed in this article. The other states may be
handled in a similar manner. The discussed values of the itemState field
are as follows:
 
   Value             Description
   -----             -----------
 
   ODS_FOCUS         The item has the input focus.
 
   ODS_SELECTED      The item is selected.
 
If neither of these bits is set, the control or item is in its
"normal" state.
 
The most frequently encountered case is to have itemAction equal to
ODA_DRAWENTIRE and neither of the monitored ODS_* bits set. If the data to
be displayed is a string of text, call TextOut() or TabbedTextOut() to draw
the text on the screen. Nontext data can be displayed with GDI functions
such as BitBlt() or Rectangle(). An application can combine these functions
as appropriate.
 
Identifying String vs. Nonstring Items
---------------------------------------
 
As discussed above, each WM_DRAWITEM message is accompanied by a far
pointer to a DRAWITEMSTRUCT. For owner-draw list boxes created with the
LBS_HASSTRINGS style, and for owner-draw combo boxes that have been created
with both the CBS_HASSTRINGS and CBS_DROPDOWNLIST styles, the itemID field
in this structure will be an index that refers to the appropriate string.
The itemData field will NOT be a far pointer to the string. To retrieve a
pointer to the string, send a message to the list box or combo box. The
wParam of the message is set to the itemID from the structure. The
following code assumes that the list box or combo box in question is in a
dialog box:
 
   LPSTR lpItem;
 
To a list box:
 
   lpItem = SendDlgItemMessage(hDlg, LBID, LB_GETTEXT,
                                     lpdis->itemID, 0L);
 
To a combo box:
 
   lpItem = SendDlgItemMessage(hDlg, CBID, CB_GETLBTEXT,
                                     lpdis->itemID, 0L);
 
LBID and CBID are the integer identifiers of the list box and combo
box, respectively, within the dialog box.
 
If the list box or combo box does not have one of the styles described
above, the 32-bit itemData field provides information to identify the
item.
 
Message Traffic for an Item with Both Selection and Focus
---------------------------------------------------------
 
An application will receive two WM_DRAWITEM messages for an item that is
both selected and has the focus.
 
For example, for an item in a single-selection list box that has the focus
and is selected, the application will first receive a WM_DRAWITEM message
with the ODA_DRAWENTIRE or ODA_SELECT action and the ODS_SELECTED state.
Then, the application will receive a second WM_DRAWITEM message with the
ODA_DRAWENTIRE or ODA_FOCUS action and the ODS_FOCUS state. Therefore, it
is important to handle the selection state separately from the focus state.
 
Handling the two attributes individually is especially important because
some functions, such as DrawFocusRect(), remove the effect of one call with
a second call. DrawFocusRect() creates the dashed rectangle border around
the text of a control with the focus.
 
A problem occurs when DrawFocusRect() is called during the processing of a
selection state message to draw the focus rectangle. If DrawFocusRect() is
called again during the processing of the focus state message, the
rectangle is removed, which is highly undesirable.
 
In Windows 3.0, if at the end of processing the WM_DRAWITEM message with
ODS_FOCUS set, the dialog box procedure returns FALSE, the Dialog Manager
code will call DrawFocusRect(). This call may serve as a safety feature in
the application, or it may introduce a problem. However, this undocumented
behavior may change in future versions of Windows and is not guaranteed.
 
Three points in summary:
 
1. The focus state should be handled separately from the selection
   state.
 
2. The application must do all necessary drawing itself.
 
3. The dialog procedure returns TRUE when processing is finished.
 
A Combo Box's Drop-Down List Box Does Not Receive the Focus
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
Only the static area of a CBS_DROPDOWNLIST owner-draw combo box will
receive the focus action or state; the dropped-down list box does not
receive the focus.
 
The static text area, which displays the selected list box item, is part of
the parent combo box window. Indicate that the combo box has received the
focus by drawing the static area appropriately. The static area can be
identified by its itemID of -1 (0xffff). The static area can also be
identified by the fact that its left side, rcItem.left, is intentionally
greater than zero to offset the selected item to the right a few pixels,
but the left side of the list box items are zero.
 
The list box is a child window of the combo box. List box items can receive
the selection action or state when they are actually selected, and also
when they are scrolled over with the mouse cursor or with the keyboard.
Upon receipt of the WM_DRAWITEM message, draw the currently selected item
appropriately.
 
Reusing Code for Equivalent Combinations of Actions and States
--------------------------------------------------------------
 
During the design phase for the application, both the actions and states
should be considered. To save work, note that some action/state
combinations are effectively equivalent. Equivalent states should result in
the item being drawn the same way, typically by a call to a function in the
application.
 
An example of common equivalent action/state combinations is ODA_DRAWENTIRE
and ODS_FOCUS versus ODA_FOCUS and ODS_FOCUS. In either case, the
application would draw the control in its focus state. Similarly,
ODA_DRAWENTIRE and ODS_SELECTED versus ODA_SELECT with ODS_SELECTED causes
the control to be drawn in its selected state.
 
A common method for processing owner-draw items is to draw the control in
its "normal" state, modify the display of the control based on its
selection state, and then modify the display of the control based upon its
focus state, as appropriate.
 
Below is an example of the common method. The following code fragment could
be inserted into the dialog box procedure of a dialog box that contains an
owner-draw list box with the LBS_HASSTRINGS style. This code processes the
WM_DRAWITEM and WM_MEASUREITEM messages:
