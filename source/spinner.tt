   This is the result of "pasting" a ToonTalk object.  You can include
this in files, email, or whatever.  To decode it just use any program
that can copy this to Window's clipboard.  For example, you can use
Window's notepad or write program.  Just be sure your selection includes
the code below and then select the Copy command in the Edit menu.
Then it will appear in the ToonTalk remote control for the clipboard.
Just use Dusty to vacuum it off the clipboard.
The following is a movie of a person walking which is partly visible. 
The first thing on the back is a box with one hole whose hole labeled
with "Picture #" contains a remote control for the picture selector. 
The second thing on the back is a robot who wants a box with one hole
whose hole contains any number.  If given a box like that he will move
to the stack of numbers.  And pick up a number.  And drop it on the
first hole of the box he's working on.  
   What follows is in a special code and was produced by ToonTalk(TM)
