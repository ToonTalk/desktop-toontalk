Introductory tour of ToonTalk.

1. Hi.  Welcome to Toontalk.  I'm Sally and I'll be glad to show you around.
If you ever want to leave the tour just press the "escape" button.  

2. If I hold down the right mouse button, we fly up.

3. And if I hold the left button, we fly down.

4. Tooly, the toolbox, follows us everywhere.

5. Let's go inside.

6. Hi Marty.  While its not too hard to read what you are saying,
I'm looking forward to the day you start talking.

7. Thanks Marty, I'll try that and pick up the number one.

8. And now I'll drop it.

9. Another good suggestion Marty.  Since I already know lots about ToonTalk,
I'm going push F1 Marty and send you away.

11. Bye.

12. Ok, I'll drop a number on a number.

13. I can use the keyboard to change numbers.

14. The hammer of Bamer the mouse can do more than just add.
Multiply, for example.

15. Let me show you what this magic wand can do.
To use anything I've picked up I just press a mouse button
while I'm holding one of the shift buttons.
I'll try it now while holding the wand.

16. The wand makes copies of things.

17. By clicking a mouse button, I'll drop the copy.

18.  Now I'll show you how to make a really big number.
I'll pick up Pumpy, the bike pump, and use him by holding down
a shift button and a mouse button.

19. Boy, I sure made a really big number.  I can make Pumpy shrink
it by using him twice since he switches back and forth between putting in air
and letting it out.

20. I guess that's too small.

21. Boxes are good for putting things in.

22. I can put our number in this box.

23. And I can take it out again.

24. If I forgot what this is I can press F1 to call for Marty.  
He'll see what I'm holding or pointing to and figures I want to hear 
everything he knows about it.   Here watch.

//25. By the way, if Marty talks too fast for you to read there is a 
//complicated way to fix it.  To slow him down add -r 50 to the command line.
//It can also be used to speed him up.
//Some day there will be an options screen around here for this kind of stuff.

25. By the way, if Marty talks too slow or too fast for you to read there is
a way to change things.  You'll find a remote control for his reading
speed on page 18 of the options notebook that you'll find on page 10 of your
main notebook.  

26. Sometimes Marty talks too slow so I push F7 to hurry him up.  
Its also good for making him skip over some stuff.

27. That's enough Marty, thanks.  Bye.

28. Ok, lets see what its like to use Dusty.

29. The neatest thing about ToonTalk is all the stuff you can train robots
to do.

30. Let's teach this one to count.

31. First we have get a box for him to work on.
Since he'll start counting from 1 we'll put a 1 in the box.

32. And give it to him.

33. As Marty is saying, we're now in the robot's thought bubble.  
As I move the mouse, our robot moves.

34. So, to count all he has to do is add 1 to the number 
he's already gotten up to.

35. That's all.  So I'll press the escape button now.

36. As Marty was saying, to see if our robot learned what we taught him
let's give him a box like the one he's thinking about.

37. Not too smart, robot old boy.  You can only count up to two.

38. Our problem is that this robot is just too fussy.  

39. See.

40. If only we can make him think about a box with any number in it.

41. Let's try using Dusty to suck up the one in his thought bubble.
This is a bit tricky.  I have to hold down the control button since
I'm doing something special with him.  On most keyboards its labeled Ctrl. 

42. Now when I press the mouse button, the number pad becomes blank.

43. Our robot is now just thinking about a box with any number in it.
Let's try him again.

44. Hmm, he's counting ok but he sure is slow.

45. Four.

46. Five.

47. Six.  Turns out that robots are real fast when no one is looking.
I'm going to press the escape button so we stand up.

48. By the way, when ToonTalk is finished you will see stuff on the floor.
And you'll be able to move around to different places on the floor.
Not yet though.

49. Let's push a mouse button to sit.

50. Wow -- he's gotten up 15,124.

51. Let's stop him.

52. Good.  Got him.

53. I usually save robots I train and stuff I build in my notebook.

54. I'm pointing to the whole notebook (see it quiver?).  When I hit the
space bar, it flips to the next page.

55. Good -- an empty page.

56. Now he's saved forever -- unless I use Dusty to suck him out.

57. I'll pick up a text pad and type "adds 1" and drop it here to
remember what he does.

58. Let's build a new house for our robot to work in.  These trucks have
a construction crew in them.

59. Let's drop our robot in the truck.

60. The driver is waiting for a box to give the robot when the house 
is built.

61. Let's start him off counting from zero.

62. Good.  Let's find the house they built.

63. Why not take the helicopter?

64. The block had only one house on it when we landed.  Let's go over to
the new house and see what's going on inside.

65. Our robot has been counting away since this house was built.

66. Enough of this.  Let's stop all this. 

67. And set off this bomb.

68. Whooo

69. All that's left to try out are the nests and scales.

70. Let's take out a nest.

71. Suppose I had no idea what birds do.  I can just try things or I can
ask Marty.  

72. I'll press F1 and ask Marty.

73. Uh huh -- rectangular -- let's try number pads -- they're rectangular.

74. And another.

75. Let's clear off her nest.

76. I wonder what our robot will do if we give him a box with a nest in it.

77. Pretty smart.  He's hasn't given up on this box.  He's hoping a bird
will come in and cover the nest with a number.

78. Let's take the bird with us to another house.

79. Now we'll spit her out.

80. Let's give her a zero.

81. Good -- and now we'll go back.

82. Good.  Ever since she delivered the zero, our robot has been counting
away.

83. See -- the nest is still here.

84. And now for scales.

85. See, if we put a scale in a hole between two numbers it tilts towards
the bigger or heavier number.  Scales work with text pads too.

86. As the last part of our tour, let's see what's in the notebook.

87. Here on page two is a notebook full of pictures and movies.

88. You can take out pictures and combine them.

89. If you press shift and click a mouse button while holding a picture it
flips over.  And out comes a different notebook.  [take out dizzy guy]

90. Let's take out two remote controls from the notebook. [x and width]

91. And flip the picture back over.

92. See how the number changes as I move the picture?  It's showing us
the distance from the left edge.

93. Watch what happens if we change the number. [drops 100 on it]

94. It moves to the new position.

95. The neatest thing about pictures is that robots can work on the back
making them do things like grow or bounce or explode or whatever.

96. Let's put our counting robot on the back and give it the box containing
the remote control for the width.

97. And flip it back over.

98. He's getting pretty fat.

99. Well that's all I was gonna show you.  Look for other tours or just
start playing with ToonTalk yourself.  You might want to see what else
is in these notebooks.  As with any of these tours press F8 at any time
and you're in charge.  If you do nothing this will end in about 30 seconds. 
Thanks for coming and see ya.
