This is a replay of when I trained a robot to produce a
sequence of Fibonacci numbers.  Each number is the sum
of the two numbers to its right.  Another robot was trained
to start things off with one and one.
If you want to play with these robots you'll find them in the
notebook of examples on page 6.
