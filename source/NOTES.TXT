Ken Kahn's notes:

Dec 27th 1993
Instructions (better baggage than "tutorials") can work by having
signs attached to objects (a la Alice in Wonderland) that say things
like "pick me up" or "copy me".  When action is done, then sign goes
away and a new sign appears.  Internally actions could be the same as
events and piggy back off of that mechanism to recognize when event is
done and where to place next sign.  Could run off a semantic log of
all events (even those that happen when no body cubby).

Signs vs visual clues.  Consider each event:

SELECT_STACK_ITEM -- stack could blink or change size (in a cycle) a
                     bit or ...
GRASP_COPIER -- tool can blink, etc.
COPY_APPLY -- target can blink, etc.
COPY_NUMBER_APPLY -- target blinks
RELEASE_COPIER -- table top blinks or item in hand blinks
GRASP_ITEM -- item blinks
RELEASE_ITEM --  table top blinks or item in hand blinks
RELEASE_ITEM_ON -- hole blinks
NUMBER_APPLY -- target blinks
GRASP_VACUUM -- 
VACUUM_APPLY --
VACUUM_APPLY_RESTORE -- table top blinks (but not used to indicate release)
RELEASE_VACUUM --
CHANGE_NUMBER -- avoid this or a sign saying "type 123"
NEW_CUBBY_SIZE -- ditto
HATCH_BIRD -- nest blinks so set it down
GIVE_BIRD_ITEM -- bird blinks while item in hand
DROP_ITEM_IN_TRUCK -- truck blinks (when done it "blinks" in another fashion)
DESTROY_HOUSE -- just now it is special case of use vacuum

Consider using effects like the way GameBoy Link enters a dream by
making the screen go wavy.  Just shift lines a few pixels...

Combine instruction idea with Markus' idea of museums.  Each house can
have a sign saying (directions for building "X").
