The Martian will give a complete description of an item if you call for him
(via F1) while holding or pointing to an item.  This is particularly useful
for getting a description of what a robot does.

If you hold down the control button while copying the box inside a robot's
thought bubble, then blanks are restored to their original values.  This is
often a good way to obtain an example box for a robot to work on.

F8 currently stops all sprites and robots.  F8 again will start them
up again.  Will be replaced by a nice graphical switch.

The 'Pause' button is a convenient way to pause or quit a demo or
session with ToonTalk.
