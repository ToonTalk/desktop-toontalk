<p><i>Visual Programming is the idea that source code would be better if text 
were replaced or augmented with pictures, diagrams, or icons. A visual program 
consists of formal diagrams that encode descriptions of dynamic processes. In a 
1965 PBS visit to MIT Lincoln Labs, we see Bert Sutherland (now head of Sun 
Labs) showing off his thesis system -- a way of entering and running programs as 
flow charts. We hear Bert saying that programmers used to program with text but 
now they program directly with pictures. But Sutherland was wrong: despite 40 
years of attempts to build visual programming systems, very few programs are 
visual. Though Visual Programming is a good fit for those few of us that are 
both formal and visual thinkers, visual programming didn't succeed because it 
doesn't go far enough. </i></p>
<p><i>Animated Programming is the idea that source code should not be a static 
abstract encoding of a process, but rather a dynamic and concrete description of 
a process. And the source code should be animated like a video game is animated, 
not an animated diagram or linked animated icons. Animated Programming is a bit 
like sign language or a game of Charades. And like sign language, there is no 
loss of expressivity; an animated programming language can be Turing-equivalent. 
As a matter of fact, it would be straightforward to build an animated 
programming language for Turing Machines since they are visual, dynamic, and 
concrete. </i></p>
<p><i>So what kind of programmer is Animated Programming good for? Those of us 
who are good at thinking about visual tangible things and processes. That may be 
a larger population than today's textual programmers, who are good at formal 
abstract thinking. Animated Programming may be the best means to "end user 
programming". It may be the best way to introduce children to the joy and power 
of programming. It might be the best first language for adults that want to 
learn to program. </i></p>
<p><i>Why should professional programmers care about Animated Programming? 
Because it provides a different way to think about programming. And having 
another way to think about programming enriches your understanding. And it may 
in fact represent the future of programming. Maybe the next generation of 
programmers will be programming from within virtual reality, by manipulating 
simulated objects. </i></p>
