<p></font><font FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="2">Following is a look behind the scenes of the
Puzzle Game within ToonTalk. Are you wondering how you are learning computer programming
while having fun? Take a look at the explanations of each puzzle and you&#146;ll be
surprised at how much you&#146;ve learned or can learn while playing ToonTalk.</font><font
FACE="Comic Sans MS"></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Level #1 - Numbers (mostly powers of 2)</strong></p>
<b>

<p><small>Puzzle #1 &#150; Marty needs a box with a 1 and 2 inside.</b> This introduces
ToonTalk boxes that are for holding things. Computer scientists call these <i>data
structures</i>. Boxes closely resemble what they call <i>arrays</i>, <i>vectors</i>, and <i>tuples</i>.
The numbers are an example of what computer scientists call <i>atomic data types</i>. To
solve this puzzle you need to figure out how to put things in boxes (i.e. how to <i>initialize
elements of a vector</i>).</small></p>
<b>

<p><small>Puzzle #2 &#150; Marty needs a 4.</b> This puzzle introduces Bammer the Mouse
who does arithmetic and other basic operations. In solving this puzzle you will discover
how to express the addition of two numbers.</small></p>
<b>

<p><small>Puzzle #3 &#150; Marty needs a box with 8, 16, and 32 inside.</b> This
introduces a way to combine boxes to make bigger boxes. It also illustrates how to express
addition of a number that is in a box. In computer science terminology you learn how to <i>concatenate
vectors</i> and how to <i>operate on an element of a data structure</i>.</small></p>
<b>

<p><small>Puzzle #4 &#150; Marty needs a number bigger than 1,000.</b> This puzzle
introduces the ToonTalk magic wand which is used to copy ToonTalk objects. Like all
ToonTalk tools, the wand can be used as part of a program and as a tool within the
programming environment. This puzzle is interesting mathematically since it relies upon
repeated doubling to grow from 1 to 1,024 in only 10 steps. It is intentionally a bit
tedious, to provide motivation for automating tasks like this later.</small></p>
<b>

<p><small>Puzzle #5 &#150; Marty needs a zero.</b> This puzzle introduces Dusty the
Vacuum. Dusty is a tool used here to remove things. The zero is buried under things that
only Dusty can remove.</small></p>
<b>

<p><small>Puzzle #6 &#150; Marty needs a &#150;1.</b> To solve this puzzle the player
needs to guess (or receive hints from Marty) that the button on Dusty&#146;s nose can be
changed by clicking on it. This use of buttons to change the behavior of tools is used
throughout ToonTalk. An observant player might notice that this use of Dusty to suck
things up and then later spit them out corresponds very closely to <i>cut and paste</i> in
many window-based interfaces.</small></p>
<b>

<p><small>Puzzle #7 &#150; Marty needs a blank number pad.</b> This puzzle introduces
blank number pads which are used in later puzzles. A blank number pad is a way of
expressing <i>the type of a data structure. </i>In this case, it indicates some data whose
<i>type</i> is <i>number</i>. </small></p>
<b>

<p><small>Puzzle #8 &#150; Marty needs a box with two zeroes.</b> In training the robot in
this puzzle, you are constructing your first program. The program constructed is
equivalent to a textual program like this:</small></p>
</font><font FACE="Terminal">

<p></font><small><font face="Times New Roman">while (sizeOf(box) = 1 and box[0] = 1) do</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box := concat(box, copy(box));</font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endwhile;</font></small><font FACE="Terminal"></p>
</font><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">

<p><small>The reason that even young children can construct this program without help, is
that the puzzle constrains the world so that the amount of searching a player needs to do
to find a solution isn&#146;t too large. Here the robot&#146;s memory is limited to
remembering only two steps, and the robot already has a magic wand. </small></p>
<b>

<p><small>Puzzle #9 &#150; Marty needs a number greater than a billion.</b> The solution
to this puzzle builds upon the experience of solving puzzles 4, 7, and 8. To solve this
puzzle you need to train a robot to do what you did manually in puzzle #4. During puzzle
#4 you had to repeat a sequence of actions 10 times. Here you simply train the robot to do
one sequence and he'll do it the needed 30 times. In order to get the robot to work
repeatedly, you need to learn about how to make the robot less fussy about the kind of box
he&#146;ll work on. In computer science jargon this is called <i>relaxing the predicate of
the conditional</i>. The textual program equivalent of the robot trained in this puzzle
is:</small></p>
</font><font FACE="Terminal">

<p></font><small><font face="Times New Roman">repeat 30</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">if (sizeOf(box) = 1 and isNumber(box[0])) then </font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">Box[0] := box[0] + copy(box[0]);</font></small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endif;</font></small><font FACE="Terminal"></p>
</blockquote>
</font><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">

<p><small><strong>Puzzle #10 - Marty needs a box inside a box. </strong>To solve this
puzzle, you need to place a box inside a box inside a box. This is what computer
scientists call <em>a recursive data structure, since elements of the structure can be of
the same type as the whole structure</em>. If you place one of the boxes in the wrong
hole, then Marty informs you that the elements need to be in the correct location. This is
because a box is <em>an ordered indexed collection</em>.</small></p>
</font>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #11 - Marty needs a box with 3 zeros. </strong>Like
puzzle #2, you need to connect (<em>concatenate</em>) two boxes (<em>vectors</em>). Here
you will discover that boxes cannot be connected when they are a part of another box. You
discover that boxes can be removed, connected, and then put back. One solution corresponds
to the code fragment:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp1 := box[0];</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp2 := box[1];</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp1 := concat(temp1,temp2);</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[1] := temp1;</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #12 - Marty needs a box with 6 zeros.</strong>
This puzzle resembles puzzle #11. The operation of connecting boxes is repeated 3 times.
This is to prepare you for the next puzzle where a robot needs to be trained to repeatedly
connect boxes.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #13 - Marty needs a box with 10 zeros.</strong>
In solving this puzzle, you train a robot to repeatedly extend a box. This introduces <em>a
programming technique commonly used when incrementally creating a data structure</em>. The
trained robot corresponds to the textual program:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">repeat 4</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">if (sizeOf(box) = 2 and sizeOf(box[0]) = 1 and
  box[0][0] = 0) then</font></small></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp1 := copy(box[0]);</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp1 := concat(temp1,box[1]);</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[1] := temp;</font></small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endif;</font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">The robot in this puzzle can remember up to 20 steps
but the puzzle can be solved with only 4.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #14 - Marty needs a box containing 1,
2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.</strong> Solving this puzzle involves repeatedly extending a box with
numbers that are twice the size of the previous number.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #15 - Marty needs a box containing 1,
2, 4, 8, 16, and so on all the way up to 1,073,741,824.</strong> Solving this puzzle
builds upon puzzles #9, #13, and #14. It is a good example of how one often needs to
combine different programming techniques to reach a goal. Here is the equivalent textual
program:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">repeat 30</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">if (sizeOf(box) = 2 and sizeOf(box[0]) = 1 and
  isNumber(box[0][0])) then</font></small></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[0][0] := box[0][0] + copy(box[0][0]);</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp1 := copy(box[0]);</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp2 := box[1];</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp2 := concat(temp2,temp1);</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[1] := temp2;</font></small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endif;</font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #16 - Marty needs the year you were
born.</strong> The powers of 2 are <em>a basis set of the positive integers</em>. In other
words, any whole number can be expressed as the sum of numbers which are the power of 2
and no number in the sum occurs more than once. Hence the lack of the magic wand in this
puzzle.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #17 - Marty needs the year you were
born in binary.</strong> You need to do exactly the same thing here as he or she did when
solving puzzle #17. This actually can be a much easier puzzle than #16. The trick is to
notice that wherever you need a 1, find a number with a 1 in that position.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzles #18, #19, and #20</strong> -
Intentionally left blank.</font></small></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">Level #2 - Letters and Words</font></strong></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #21 - Marty needs a box with A, B, and
C. </strong>This puzzle introduces text pads (<em>a new data type</em>). In solving this
puzzle, you will discover what the addition operation does when applied to letters.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #22 - Marty needs a box with A, B, C,
D, E, and F. </strong>This puzzle is similar to puzzle #14 but the same technique is now
applied to letters rather than numbers.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #23 - Marty needs a box with A, B, C,
and so on up to Z.</strong> This puzzle builds upon puzzles #15 and #22. Like #15, you
needs to train a robot to do one step in such a way that when he's done he'll be ready to
do the next step. The equivalent textual program is:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">repeat 20 </font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">if (sizeOf(box) = 3 and box[0] = 1 and
  sizeOf(box[1]) = 1 and isText(box[1][0])) then</font></small></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp1 := copy(box[1]);</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[1][0] := box[1][0] + copy(box[0]);</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp2 := box[2];</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp2 := concat(temp2,temp1);</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[2] := temp2;</font></small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endif;</font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #24 - Marty needs a box with a, b, c,
and so on up to z.</strong> This puzzle is trivial because the robot that was trained in
the previous puzzle can create the box needed here. All the robot needs, is to be given a
different box to begin with. A robot is what is called <em>a procedure</em> by computer
scientists. And <em>this procedure </em>has<em> one argument</em> - the box that is given
to the robot. A very important aspect of a procedure is that it can be reused by <em>passing
</em>it different<em> arguments</em>.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #25 - Marty needs a box with the
alphabet that is small enough to see all at once.</strong> This puzzle introduces a new
tool - Pumpy The Bike Pump. Pumpy changes the size of things. This is useful in 'Free
Play' for managing screen real estate. It is also an easy and direct way to change the
size of pictures.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #26 - Marty needs a box with a period,
question mark, and comma.</strong> This puzzle illustrates that text pads are not limited
to letters of the alphabet but include punctuation as well. Letters, punctuation, and
special symbols (like $) are called <em>characters</em> in most programming languages.
This puzzle also dramatically illustrates that the size of objects in ToonTalk doesn't
influence on how they behave (their <em>semantics</em>).</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #27 -Marty needs the box with
punctuation to be big enough to see its contents.</strong> This puzzle introduces a <em>keyboard
accelerator</em> - in this case, a way to create a sound to call for Pumpy to jump into
your hand. Keyboard accelerators are common in many different kinds of user interfaces.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #28 - Marty needs the word
&quot;start&quot;.</strong> This puzzle introduces what computer scientists call <em>strings</em>
- i.e. <em>sequences of characters</em>. To solve this puzzle you need to discover that
letters and strings can be concatenated to form longer strings.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzles #29 and #30</strong> - Intentionally
left blank.</font></small></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">Level #3 - Mathematics of Time</font></strong></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #31 - Marty needs a box with your
birthday.</strong> To solve this puzzle, you needs to discover that the keyboard can be
used to change the value of strings and numbers. This is a kind of <em>direct manipulation
of data</em>.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #32 - Marty wants to know the number
of minutes in a day.</strong> This puzzle illustrates that repeated addition is
multiplication. The equivalent textual program is:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">repeat 24</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">if (sizeOf(box) = 2 and isNumber(box[0]) and
  isNumber(box[1])) then</font></small></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[1] := box[1] + copy(box[0]);</font></small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endif;</font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #33 - Marty wants to know the number
of seconds in an hour.</strong> The robot from puzzle #32 is re-used here, as the only
difference is how many times the instructions should be repeated.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #34 - Marty needs a box showing a set
of scales that shows two numbers are the same. </strong>This puzzle introduces scales
which are a way of expressing <em>numeric comparisons</em>. It also introduces the use of
negative numbers for subtraction.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #35 - Marty needs another box with a
scale showing that two numbers are the same.</strong> This puzzle differs from the
previous, because now a robot is doing the work. What is important to note here is that
the robot stops when the scale is no longer titled to the left. This example shows how to
use <em>a comparison predicate in a conditional</em>. Since this robot has a wand with
unlimited magic, he stops only when the box no longer matches the box in his thought
bubble. This is what computer scientists call a <em>while loop</em>. The textual
equivalent is:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">while (sizeof(box) = 4 and box[1] = '&gt;' and
isNumber(box[0]) and isNumber(box[2]) and isNumber(box[3])) then</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[2] := box[2] + copy(box[3]);</font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endwhile;</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">The expression &quot;</font><font FACE="Terminal">box[1]
= '&gt;'</font><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">&quot; is unusual. In this case it is equivalent
to the more common &quot;</font><font FACE="Terminal">box[0] &gt; box[2]</font><font
FACE="Comic Sans MS">&quot;, since the scale is always displaying the relationship between
its neighboring data.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #36 - Marty needs a box with 24 zeros.</strong>
This puzzle combines puzzles #13 and #35.&nbsp; It shows how to use the <em>while loop</em>
like a <em>for statement</em>. This is an important technique for repeating something a
number of times when you don't know how many times it will need to be repeated until the
program runs. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">Computer scientists analyze programs to find <em>invariants</em>.
These are relationships that hold after every cycle. Here there is invariant that the
first hole of the box is a number which is the size (i.e. number of holes) of the box in
the sixth hole. The textual equivalent of the robot is:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">while (sizeof(box) = 6 and box[1] = '&lt;' and
isNumber(box[0]) and isNumber(box[2]) and isNumber(box[3])) do</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp1 := copy(box[4]);</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp2 := box[5];</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp2 := concat(temp2,temp1);</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[5] := temp2;</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[0] := box[0] + copy(box[3]);</font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endwhile;</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">or equivalently:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">if (sizeof(box) = 6 and box[1] = '&lt;' and
isNumber(box[0]) and isNumber(box[2]) and isNumber(box[3])) then</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">for (; box[0] &lt; box[2]; box[0] := box[0] +
  copy(box[3])) do</font></small></p>
  <blockquote>

    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp2 := box[5];</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">temp2 := concat(temp2,temp1);</font></small></p>

</blockquote>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endif;</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #37 - Marty wants to know how many
hours there are in a year.</strong> This is similar to puzzle #32 except that now, you are
training a more generally useful robot. That is because this robot computes the product of
the first 2 numbers and keeps it in the sixth hole. The <em>invariant</em> in this program
is that the number in the sixth hole is the product of the numbers in the first and fourth
holes. The robot stops when the numbers in the second and fourth hole are the same. The
textual equivalent of this is:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">while (sizeof(box) = 6 and box[1] &gt; box[3] and

</blockquote>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endwhile;</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #38 - Marty wants to know how many
seconds are in a day.</strong> To solve this puzzle, you use the robot trained in the
previous puzzle to multiply 60 times 24 resulting in 1,440. The player then uses the robot
again to multiply 60 times 1,440. This can be done by placing the 60 in either the first
or second hole and the 1,440 in the other. The robot will compute the product correctly in
either case but it will be much faster if the 1,440 is in the first hole. This happens,
because the robot multiplies by repeatedly adding the first number. The amount of work the
robot must do is proportional to the number in the second hole. In computer science
terminology, we say <em>the</em> <em>program's complexity is linear with the second
argument</em>.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #39 - Marty wants to know how many
seconds are in a year.</strong> Like the previous puzzle, this one repeatedly uses the

stream of numbers.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #47 - Marty wants the number that
results from waiting 8 seconds.</strong> Here you run the robot from puzzle #43 and the
robot from puzzle #45 <em>in parallel</em>, in other words, at the same time.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #48 - Marty wants the number that
results from waiting 14 seconds. </strong>To solve this puzzle, you need to <em>spawn a
new process</em> by loading the truck with a robot and box. This is the preferred method
of running programs in parallel - doing it within a single house is harder to control and
gets messy quickly. Here you will learn that the sensor measures the number of
milliseconds since the last ToonTalk cycle. Hence the sum of the numbers measures how much
time has passed. If you left for exactly 8 seconds on puzzle #47 the number would have
been 8,000. Here if you went away for exactly 14 seconds the number would be 14,000. The
reason you need to get out of sight is that the birds slow down for your benefit so you
can watch them. Slow birds interfere here with measuring time accurately.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #49 - Marty wants you to get rid of
the other house.</strong> To solve this puzzle you need to discover how to <em>terminate a
process</em>. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #50 - Marty wants the results from
waiting 10 seconds.</strong> This time you need to train a single robot to do what the
robots in puzzles #47 and #48 accomplished. Programmers often make a special program that
does the same as the combination of two general programs. They do this because the
computer needs to do fewer steps to run the special program. Here the generator and
consumer processes can be combined into a faster and much simpler process. The textual
equivalent is:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">while (sizeOf(box) = 2 and isNumber(box[1]) and
isNumber(box[2])) do</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">box[1] := box[1] + copy(box[0]);</font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endwhile;</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #51 - Marty needs the box after the 3
second timer goes off.</strong> This puzzle combines puzzles #35 and #50 to measure time
until some comparison is no longer true. The reason the box has 6 holes rather than 4
becomes apparent later. Here is the textual form:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">while (sizeOf(box) = 6 and isNumber(box[0]) and
isNumber(box[1]) and isNumber(box[3])and box[1] &lt; box[3]) do</font></small></p>

</blockquote>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endwhile;</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #52 - Marty needs -10.</strong> This
puzzle illustrates the repeated use of -1 to <em>decrement a counter</em>. It is equally
valid to view this as adding a negative number or subtracting a positive one. The textual
equivalent is:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">while (sizeOf(box) = 3 and isNumber(box[0]) and
isNumber(box[1])) do</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #53- Marty wants the secret word.</strong>
This puzzle introduces teams of robots. When a box is given to a robot and that box
doesn't match the box in the robot's thought bubble then the robot will leave the box for
the next robot in the team, if there is one. In procedural programming languages, this
corresponds to what computer scientists call <em>if-then-else statements</em>. In
object-oriented programming languages, a team corresponds to <em>the behavior of an object</em>
where each robot corresponds to <em>a method</em>. In logic programming languages, a team
corresponds to <em>a predicate</em> and each robot to <em>a clause</em>. The team
constructed in this puzzle is equivalent to the following procedural textual program:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">procedure team(Box box)</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">if (sizeOf(box) = 3 and box[0] = 0 and box[1] = -1
  and box[2] = 'a') then</font></small></p>

Here the robot trained for puzzle #51 is used together with the one trained here to

is:</font></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font face="Times New Roman">if&nbsp; (sizeOf(box) = 6 and isNumber(box[0]) and

<p align="center"><big><strong><font FACE="Comic Sans MS">Level #5 - Building a Clock</font></strong></big></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #61 - Marty wants a number that keeps
getting bigger.</strong> The solution to this puzzle is the same as puzzle #50. Here,
however, the number being changed has a special property so that changes to it show up on
the other number as well. This is what computer scientists call <em>shared state</em>.
Shared state is known to cause problems in concurrent programs. In ToonTalk, however,
remote controls work only within a single house so these problems are avoided.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #62 - Marty&nbsp; wants the number to
increase by 1,000 every second.</strong> The solution to this puzzle requires placing the
robot and his box on the back of the number. Many software development systems provide
user interface objects that can have programs associated with them. In ToonTalk, you can
put robots on the back of pictures to give them any behavior you program. The reason that
the solution to this puzzle keeps time correctly, while the solution to the previous one
didn't, is that in the previous puzzle the robot was going slow so you could observe him.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #63 - Marty wants a number that
increases by 1 every second.</strong> The solution to this builds upon the programming
techniques used in level #4. One of the <em>invariants</em> of this robot is that the
number in the third hole should be 1 less than 1,000 times the number in the fourth hole.
Another <em>invariant</em> is that the fourth number will be 1/1000th of the value of the
first number. The textual form of this robot is:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">while (sizeof(box) = 6 and box[0] &gt; box[2] and
isNumber(box[0]) and isNumber(box[2]) and isNumber(box[3]) and isNumber(box[4])&nbsp; and

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #64 - Marty wants a number that
increases by 1 every minute.</strong> This puzzle reuses the robot from the previous
puzzle. The numbers have been changed so that the robot ensures that the fourth number is
1/60th of the first number.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #65 - Marty needs a box with hours,
minutes, and seconds timers.</strong> Constructing the hour timer is the same as
constructing the minute timer in the previous puzzle.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #66 - Marty wants the seconds timer to
go back to 0 when it reaches 60.</strong> After the robot runs the first number will be
the remainder after dividing what was there by 60. Computing the remainder of the division
is implemented by repeated subtraction. It is worth noting that this process is <em>running
in parallel</em> with the earlier constructed process that makes the number be 1/1000th of
the milliseconds timer. This robot is equivalent to:</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">while (sizeOf(box) = 4 and box[0] &gt; box[2] and

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman">endwhile;</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #67 - Marty wants the minutes timer to
go back to 0 when it reaches 60.</strong> The solution to this puzzle requires noticing
that the same robot is needed here as with the previous puzzle and that you can use the
magic wand to copy the needed robot.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #68 - Marty wants the hours timer to
go back to 0 when it reaches 24.</strong> The solution to this puzzle is the same as the
previous puzzle and additionally you must change the numbers so that the robot behaves
correctly. This tests your understanding of the previous two puzzles.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #69 - Marty wants the digital clock to
show the right time.</strong> To solve this puzzle, you simply <em>initialize</em> the

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #70 - Marty wants a nicer looking
digital clock.</strong> Most modern software not only needs to compute correctly, but it
also should display information to users in an appealing and effective manner. Here, you
need to make the clock look more attractive.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #71 - Marty wants a box showing the

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #72 - Marty wants to know how many

drop the number showing your age in seconds on the zero to freeze the number. If you try
to subtract with the timer then the number continues to get larger even when it is
negative. Neglecting to do so will only affect the answer by a few seconds.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #73 - Marty wants to know how many
minutes until you are a round number of millions of seconds old.</strong> This puzzle
illustrates how ToonTalk, like most programming languages, can perform division <em>primitively</em>.
Since the ship's computer was broken before you couldn't directly multiply or divide
numbers and had to program those operations using addition and subtraction.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font FACE="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Puzzle #74 - Marty wants to know how many
