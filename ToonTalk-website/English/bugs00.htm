<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/4/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a picture is erased and another picture is dropped on
    top, the erased picture loses its parts and gains the parts of the picture on top. (As
    before it also gets the appearance of the picture on top.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copy an inactive picture then copy is also inactive
    now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Parts sensor now updates when the picture is flipped back
    over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems where pictures that got a new appearance
    by being erased and a new picture dropped on top didn't behave as they should.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed an occasional problem where the hat or hair of the
    programmer wasn't displayed if a picture of the programmer had been added to another
    picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">It used to be that Pumpy would not change the size of Tooly
    if 'G' for Good Size was selected.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/5/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem were if you erased the remote looks for a
    picture and dropped a picture with pictures on top the geometry of the pictures was wrong.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another geometry problem with replacing the appearance
    of a picture with another.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now start and stop a picture by typing space or '.'
    to the remote control for the looks of the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture with pictures on top was saved where some of the
    parts were inactivated they are now inactive when restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes leaving ToonTalk and coming back and then making a
    user defined sound broke things. (Bug introduced in November.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/7/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;-language&quot; command line option now accepts
    &quot;PT&quot; as an abbreviation for Portuguese from Portugal.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In anticipation of major changes to birds so that they can
    fly between computers, you now get a nice warning if you try to load in a bird or nest
    which is network aware (even though no such birds and nests exist yet and won't for a
    couple of months).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/8/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The language specific DLLs now specify whether addresses
    should display as number followed by word or word followed by number.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made changes to how Marty describes things so it works for
    grammars as different as English and Japanese.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/9/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made improvements to how Marty describes pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/10/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you change the color of a number (by flipping it over and
    using the &quot;Which Picture&quot; sensor) then it now saves correctly so that when
    reloaded it has the right color.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes pictures when flipped and
    then flipped back got the wrong size (the size they were when flipped).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made improvements to how Marty is saved if a city is saved
    while he is visible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is in a notebook or box, sometimes time was
    wasted checking if it was involved in any collisions.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/12/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos files were recording which voice Marty spoke with so it
    could not be overridden by the user.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/13/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way objects are saved and restored so they are
    restored with the identical appearance they had when saved - even if they were animating.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The main notebook now remembers better where you place him
    and uses it as a default next time you sit down.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/14/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the button on a magic wand
    wasn't placed right.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/15/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Cities now save more things like whether the power is off or
    programmer is hidden.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">State of the programmer is now saved in cities more
    accurately.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/17/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can now correctly save a city while holding a magic wand.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/18/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can now properly save a city where Dusty has erased things.
    Earlier strange things happened if you ran Dusty in reverse in the restored city.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk doesn't have enough time to do everything then
    some animation cycles are updated only every second or third time. The way this works was
    improved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">More accurate saving and restoring of the appearance of
    objects (exact position and where in an animation cycle).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you erased something with Dusty, dropped the erased thing
    in a notebook, and then ran Dusty in reverse ToonTalk sometimes crashed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where some connections between objects were
    lost when the city was saved and restored.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/19/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If robots were running while a city was saved they are now
    restored so that they continue running where they were when saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the label of a notebook wasn't always
    displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you took the box that a robot was working on and dropped
    in a notebook (without grabbing the robot to stop him) ToonTalk sometimes crashed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/24/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of text pads sometimes changing
    when they shouldn't.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/25/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem specifying which demo to run where both the
    user and the system added DMO sometimes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk behaves better now if you give a full path name with
    extension to a sensor like &quot;file to picture&quot; and the file doesn't exist.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/26/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When displaying Unicode (e.g. Japanese) in a talk balloon it
    was not centered vertically well.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/27/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further changes to how Marty describes things so it
    works for grammars as different as English and Japanese.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty explains during the Puzzle Game how you can get hints
    from him in more appropriate contexts now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved how very long text strings (e.g. URLs) inside of
    talk balloons are displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Unicode text fits much better now inside of talk balloons.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the notebook on the back of a
    picture became invisible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changing the width or height of a picture using remote
    controls sometimes also changed the x and y position sensors for the picture. This is
    because the x and y sensors measure where the center of the picture is from the edge of
    the screen (or picture it is on top of).&nbsp; You can add
    &quot;OldBehaviorWhenChangingSize=1&quot; to the &quot;Switches&quot; section of your
    toontalk.ini file to get the old behavior. The new behavior has the nice property that it
    doesn't matter what order you change the size and change the position of a picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/30/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where connections between saved objects
    wasn't restored properly occasionally.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/31/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty had something important to say
    but you were outside at the time and then sometimes he didn't beam in to tell you when
    walk inside a house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where robots where running, you turned off
    power, and then dropped the robots in a notebook where it sometimes crashed ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/1/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something goes wrong while saving a city a broken city
    file is no longer left behind. Instead a dialog box informs you of the problem and the old
    city file is left alone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you vacuumed up both a picture and its remote looks and
    spit out the remote looks it behaved strangely.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading pictures where on the back is a robot
    with a remote looks of the picture in its thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a team of robots was stopped (e.g. by F8) and then part of
    the team vacuumed away and destroyed then when F8 was pressed again ToonTalk would
    sometimes crash.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A major new feature - time travel - started working (but is
    still buggy). See <a href="http://www.toontalk.com/English/ttravel.htm">www.toontalk.com/English/ttravel.htm</a>
    for details.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/2/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk had troubles describing things that included a
    erased force feedback effect.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk saved remote controls using joysticks incorrectly -
    these are now loaded in OK anyway.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/3/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now put whole houses on the clipboard. Just type
    control-c while standing in a house and then type control-v while outside. A copy of the
    house will be built on the block you are on. Everything is saved - stuff in side and
    decoration.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/4/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A new sensor has been added to the 'Sensors' notebook. It
    shows the language (e.g. &quot;English&quot; or &quot;Swedish&quot;) that is currently in
    effect.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/6/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a general text-to-speech engine (not like the built-in one
    that causes Marty to spell things he can't say) is in effect then it is now passed text
    without any preprocessing to deal with numbers, hyphens, etc. This assumes the engine can
    do at least as good a job at this as ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed more problems loading in remote controls for joystick
    buttons.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you save something with user pictures or sounds in it,
    Marty gives you a warning. Repetitions of this warning for additional pictures or sounds
    is given a low importance and usually is not spoken but ends up in the user text log file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the toontalk.ini &quot;Switches&quot; section has the
    entry &quot;DontOpenInternetConnection=1&quot; then ToonTalk will not even try to make an
    Internet connection for reading URLs.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/7/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk had a limit to the size of an encoding in a page of
    a notebook (64K). It now is limited by the general limit to encodings of 2,000,000.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems Marty had describing some kinds of remote
    controls with pictures for values.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes getting up from the ground altered the location of
    things left on the ground.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with pasting houses with the geometry of
    decorations.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/8/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The clipboard sensor now ignores rooms, houses, or cities on
    the clipboard. It only re-creates single objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Greatly improved the accuracy of the geometric relationship
    of pictures. This was causing small objects to get smaller (sometimes so small they
    couldn't be seen) and things on the wall decoration to drift to the left bottom corner.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A bad BMP file (one that Windows Paint can't read) sometimes
    crashed ToonTalk. Now a warning is presented and just that object isn't displayed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/9/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The recently introduce &quot;Copy of Me&quot; page of the
    remote control notebook of a picture has been decommissioned. It had various problems and
    there is a much better way of having a robot create a copy of a picture it is on the back
    of. It just erases a new picture and drops the remote control for the looks of a picture
    on it. A copy of the picture is produced.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some remote controls from the Options notebook overrode the
    setting of 'Set Options' because of the state they were saved in.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when you flipped over a picture you'd see robots on
    top of box. They are now always under the boxes.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a notebook was added to the main notebook and then taken
    out and put in another notebook, ToonTalk sometimes got confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty gives an explanation of how to change pictures using
    '+' less often if you press space while pointing to or holding a picture and there is
    nothing on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now put anything on the back of a picture (except for
    Tooly and his friends).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">F12 used to put a snapshot on the clipboard. Control-F12 does
    that now. F12 is now for tossing pictures. If you press F12 while holding a picture it
    will move off in the direction that it was recently moving. F11 no longer also does any
    kind of tossing but is exclusively for ignoring what is underneath.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed an occasional problem when saving a picture and its
    notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the remote control for the looks of something that
    has pictures on top of it would display the pictures on top intermittently.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem standing up while holding the magic wand and
    then sitting down again.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you moved to the corner or wall while sitting on the
    floor in a resolution greater than 640x480 the wall or corner wasn't displayed correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you vacuumed up Tooly and then vacuumed up other objects
    and spit them out again they began very narrow.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Standing up and sitting while Marty was talking sometimes
    resulting in a blank talk balloon.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The variable width font text pads used in the built-in
    notebook now do not show the background (they are set to &quot;show some&quot; not
    &quot;show all&quot;).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to the accuracy of the geometry
    with which parts of a picture are saved and restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no longer a delay from when a picture is destroyed
    (e.g. dropped in a notebook) and its remote controls become inactive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A flipped picture used to match the same picture unflipped.
    No longer. Two flipped pictures match only if the would match if both were flipped over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that occurred while quitting ToonTalk with Tooly
    inside of Dusty.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty is able to describe trucks much better. And Marty
    didn't used to be able to describe trucks or notebooks if they were inside of something
    else.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many internal errors are now just added to the user's log
    file rather than spoken by Marty.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The parts of a picture inside of a box in a thought bubble
    are not displayed since they are not considered in the matching process.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures inside of things sometimes forgot the &quot;good
    size&quot; when saved and restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping Tooly on a robot sometimes crashed ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Birds would sometimes incorrectly fly to their nest when it
    was in a box in a robot's thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nests in thought bubbles once again only match empty nests.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Corrupted files or clippings sometimes caused ToonTalk to
    freeze or crash. Now a nice error message appears and one can continue without the badly
    encoded objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping a remote control for the looks of a picture (A) on
    an erased picture (B) now copies the things on the back of the A and places them on B
    which becomes a complete copy of A - just the same as if the magic wand copied A. But
    robots can do this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now handles errors within errors better.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you didn't see what a bird was carrying.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now treats pictures in boxes given to robots that
    have remote controls for their looks in use as if it was a remote control itself. So
    robots won't quit but will wait for some other robot to change the picture via one of the
    remote controls for the looks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a scale had an ordinary number or text pad on
    its left and remote control on the right, that a robot would give up even though the value
    on the right might change tilting the scale so it matches.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you took out a team of robots of 3 or more, removed the
    first one and then either gave the others a box or put the one you removed on the team so
    it ends up at the end ToonTalk got confused and sometimes crashed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots wasted CPU time sometimes when the power was off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The encoding for objects for the clipboard now uses '-'
    instead of '/'. (Old clippings still work fine.) This is because many mailers thought that
    // at the beginning of a line indicated a file added &quot;file:&quot; which broke the
    encoding.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;Directories&quot; section of toontalk.ini can now
    have the entry FileSearchPath. This is a list of paths separated by semicolons. * is used
    to indicate the current user's name. For example, &quot;</font>FileSearchPath=c:\tmp;c:\temp\;*\sounds;http://www.toontalk.com/Pictures;http://www.toontalk.com/Sounds/;c:\*\puzzles;&quot;</li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Holding down shift while typing control-c puts an encoding of
    the object on the clipboard as before. But any user media (pictures or sounds) are saved
    with a reference to just the short file name and not the entire path that created it. This
    is especially useful for converting an application that uses URLs to references to local
    files to be found on the FileSearchPath entry.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The random number sensor now produces values from 0 to 999
    inclusive. 1,000 is no longer produced. This simplifies using it to compute other random
    numbers. For example, numbers from 0 to 9 by dividing by 100. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes text pads on the back of pictures became blank when
    there was a tiny remote looks of the picture also on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pumpy no longer changes the size of multiple objects. You
    need to turn him off and then on again to have him work on another object. This is because
    too often he changed the size of multiple objects unintentionally.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a text pad with a full path but no extension
    of a sensor like &quot;File to Picture&quot; it didn't work.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk used FileSearchPath for user files for notebooks and
    cities. This broke things if the FileSearchPath included URLs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User sounds defined by a URL were being saved referring to
    the temporary cache file name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If FileSearchPath includes a URL then files found are cached
    now.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You sometimes saw what a bird was carrying even when the bird
    was flying from one place to another of the back of the same picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Containers sensor didn't update properly if in a box on
    the back of a picture and that picture was flipped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you stopped a picture (e.g. by typing '.' to it), then
    pictures inside of boxes on the back of the picture weren't stopped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 21 released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Boxes on walls (e.g. inside the rocket in the puzzle game)
    weren't displaying their contents right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way text is distributed when a subtitle needs
    more than one line.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where pictures were sometimes displayed with
    the wrong size when erased, replaced by another picture, saved, and then restored.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a month old problem where sometimes objects got stuck
    at such a small size that they couldn't be seen.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes sensors got disconnected from their pictures when
    saved in a notebook (but not when saved in a city or the clipboard).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an error occurs saving something in a notebook, then
    ToonTalk gives users a warning and should neither crash nor destroy the item that was
    being saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty gave inappropriate advice if you
    typed space to a picture of a number or a remote control for the looks of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented a new policy so that if unflipped pictures are on
    the back of pictures they run only when flipped. Unless they are in a box that a robot is
    working on - then they are active whether the picture is flipped or not.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem dropping pictures on erased pictures where
    sometimes they ended up flipped and things on the back were lost.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Began to add more useful information to the user's log file
    as to why robot's stopped. For example, if a robot drops a picture on a number you now get
    descriptions of the items involved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The number of items that can be saved at one time was
    increased (the restriction is really on the number of items that are shared - e.g. birds
    of the same nest or sensors of the same picture - it is now 64K instead of 32K).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sometimes loading cities that were saved
    while robots were running.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several memory leaks that caused ToonTalk to slow down
    and also to crash Windows after running ToonTalk for a long time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where only the version with debugging code
    run properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk didn't maintain log files
    unless time travel was enabled. In other words GenerateLogs can be set while
    SecondsBetweenLogs isn't.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk Beta 21A released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta22"><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/1</font> </a>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot running on the back of a picture loads up a truck
    with an address (as well as a box and robot team), then a new house is made and the robot
    will run there. As before with no address the robot will run on the back of the picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot would wait for sensors to change when even
    if they did it would fail to match. The sensor now must be a cause of the robot failing to
    match.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange things sometimes happened if you vacuumed up Tooly
    the Toolbox and then set off a bomb.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem of vacuuming up Tooly the Toolbox and then
    sitting down in a new room.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem replaying logs of running the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the way things work if you use both the -i and -o
    switches to read an old demo and write a new one.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed demo logs so that can be created to either include a
    copy of the current notebook or to start with a new one (which will be different for
    different language versions of ToonTalk).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem preventing you from flipping over the remote
    looks of a picture and then dropping a flipped picture on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty didn't say the right things when
    you finished the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If somehow Tooly or his friends were saved with very large
    sizes, it is now fixed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">One way that Tooly was sometimes given a crazy size was when
    you ran free play, then play game, and then free play.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made small improvements to how demo logs are created.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When time travel is enabled the city is saved when you exit.
    This no longer happens if the exit was due to internal errors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now suggests you try a higher screen resolution if
    you have a very high frame rate and are running 640x480 or higher. (Previously it only
    suggested this is if you were running 320x240.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You no longer see a bird fly to a nest on the back of a
    picture if she is coming from another house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug when a robot blew up a picture you were holding.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with how Marty spoke words with hyphens in
    them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem adding things to the back of a remote control
    for the looks of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The remote control for the looks of something sometimes
    changes size to match the size of the picture it is the remote looks of. This caused them
    to become very very small when the original picture was on the back of a picture in a box.
    This behavior now applies only if the size is more than a minimum (5% of screen width and
    height).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a month old bug in how robots were sometimes loaded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is part of a picture that is made so small that
    the picture gets a width or height of zero, it got stuck at that size even when expanded.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now puts up a nice dialog box when given an old demo
    file to run. (Old demos must be run by older versions of ToonTalk.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are using Pumpy to shrink something then he keeps
    shrinking it even if the end of his hose moves around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are using Pumpy to change something to a good size,
    the center of the object no longer moves.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a demo is being played with subtitles then Marty will use
    talk balloons even if subtitles were requested by 'Set Options'.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that prevent new demo log files from being
    run if the language DLL (e.g. usnt32.dll) was for an older version.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various problems with address remote controls when you
    changed them manually or turned them on and off. Thanks Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with boxes on pictures (currently only in the
    puzzle game - on the wall of the house or rocket).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the built-in notebooks lost
    their labels.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Marty beamed in to give some advice or warning then
    sometimes before leaving he would notice what you are pointing to or holding and start to
    give advice about that as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where the user log file gave
    the wrong puzzle numbers when running Play Game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The high screen resolutions can now run even if you don't
    have high resolution graphics (an m25 file from a CD-ROM installation). Text will be much
    sharper and you can shrink objects down and see them better.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Change of policy to what happens when remote controls of a
    picture are delivered by bird to a nest on the back on another picture. It used to be that
    the &quot;allegiance&quot; of the remote controls was switched to the new picture (that it
    is no the back of). This lead to unexpected behavior.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recent problem with describing pictures either by
    Marty or for the clipboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes loading something containing a user picture whose
    file is no longer available led to instabilities.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a user picture is missing its file then as before it is
    replaced with a text pad with the file name on it. This pad was sometimes very large or
    small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem playing back demos that started in a saved
    city.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with demo logs of running the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fix for address remote controls on 3/13 broke keyboard
    actions on other remotes. They work fine now as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you typed 'u' (or the letter for your localized language
    version) while on the floor and your hand was empty then you stood up (unless the thing
    under your hand processed the 'u'). This now happens only if nothing is under your hand.
    Thanks to Ross for bringing this up. (On 3/22 also changed this so 'u' is ignored if you
    hide your hand.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some remaining places where Marty gives the obsolete
    advice that using space will change the value of a sensor. He now recommends you use '+'.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak when running narrated demos.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demo logs now recall whether they are using Unicode
    internally (e.g. for Japanese) and replay appropriately.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demo logs also remember whether they were recorded with an
    alternate spoken language.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that Marty sometimes had when describing
    remote controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes dropping a picture with robots on the back on to a
    notebook caused it to have the wrong size when taken from the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while initializing ToonTalk couldn't find a file then the
    message box sometimes had only the file name in it. It now always has a message saying
    that the file couldn't be found.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where when running a demo log it created a
    file noname.txt rather than &lt;user name&gt;.txt. Where user name is the name used when
    creating the demo log.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you give a toss to a picture and drop it on another
    picture then the apparent speed is preserved. It used to be that the speed depended upon
    the size of the underlying picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now (once again) toss a picture that is still
    attached to a magic wand.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ask for a screen resolution that is greater than your
    computer is capable of it, you now get a warning it resets the default to the next smaller
    size.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">StartTT.exe can now show an AVI movie when started. Typically
    a publisher's logo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated 'Set Options' so that higher screen resolutions
    aren't disabled for non-CD-ROM installations.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">'Set Options' now displays your choice of voices for Marty
    even if only one is available.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems creating log files when the ToonTalk speed is
    set very low.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot is dropping something on a hole of a box that is
    occupied by certain remote controls (e.g. the Containers sensor), then it didn't work
    right if everything was very small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer supports multiple resolution of demos. If
    a demo requires say 640x480 screen resolution then that is how it will run regardless of
    the settings (e.g. 'Set Options').</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way Marty speaks numbers in Portuguese (both
    Brazilian and European versions).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where robots are still
    running after flipping a picture over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes robots on the back of a picture wouldn't run when
    they should.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a robot running on the back of a picture dropped
    something it became activated. This is costly and may not be the intended behavior and so
    is no longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty sometimes gave a warning about a
    robot having a box that doesn't match and no one he can give it to when an earlier robot
    in the team should suspend waiting for a sensor to change. Thanks to Jakob for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you used a sound defined by a user wave file, paused
    ToonTalk, and then vacuumed up the sound sometimes ToonTalk broke.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a limited text-to-speech engine is used like the default
    voices for Marty, then text-to-speech sounds now process the text to deal with some of
    these limitations. Numbers, for example, should be spoken correctly now. If a general
    text-to-speech engine is involved it is assumed it can handle any text.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sound pads now have a different color. This is so it is
    easier to see the difference between sounds and numbers. This change requires a new m25 or
    m22 file.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you press 'u' (or the localized equivalent) while sitting
    on the floor with an empty hand and not pointing to something, you'll stand up. This is no
    longer the case if you have made your hand invisible.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where upon exit, ToonTalk is trying to put up
    a dialog box asking if you want to learn how to change the screen resolution and strange
    things happened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when running the built-in demos in ToonTalk
    where it didn't find the narration files on the ToonTalk CD-ROM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if ToonTalk is run directly after
    installation and before ever running 'Set Options' that some option settings were not so
    good.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now supports file extensions TT. If you double click
    on one of these (or click on a link to one from a web browser) then the ToonTalk object
    encoded in the text of the TT file is added to a running ToonTalk (when you are on the
    floor). If a ToonTalk isn't running one is launched. If no object is encoded by the TT
    file, then the text object of the contents of the TT file is loaded.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer suggests you run at a higher resolution if
    you are already running at 1024x768 or higher.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced a week earlier that caused Marty to
    reset his user profile so he treated every user as a new user.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem running the Introductory Tour in some
    language versions where Marty stayed around and confused things during the first robot
    training.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a month old problem that sometimes caused teams of
    robots to not load in properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Encoded objects in TT files (see 3/25 entry) now run when
    added to the floor unless they were saved turned off.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot on the back of a picture set off a bomb then the
    picture is destroyed. But for a short period after being destroyed it can be picked up by
    the &quot;Hit Who?&quot; sensor and trouble followed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to drop something on a hole and when
    running if the hole contains a parts or containers sensor then the thing dropped got
    passed to the box on the sensor. But if that box had more than one hole then it might end
    up on any of the holes. Now it is always the first hole. (If dropped by hand then the
    geometry of the drop determines where it ends up.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when some sensors were transferred (by robot) to
    the back of a new picture, then the value wasn't always updated and sometimes showed the
    value appropriate for the picture it was sensing before.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A few sensors like the clipboard sensor misbehaved if erased
    by Dusty and then the value changed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is erased and replaced by another picture that
    had been erased and replaced by another picture, then internally ToonTalk kept a chain of
    links that wasted time and memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak due to parts and containers sensors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a somewhat recent problem saving a city while on the
    floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where robots didn't always resume running
    when F8 was pressed for the second time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a picture with robots on the back was
    erased and another picture dropped on top.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if a picture was destroyed by a robot on the
    back while inside of a vacuum.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fix problem on 3/26 where Marty treated everyone as a new
    user only worked if the user name was the same including case. The fix is now case
    insensitive.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another problem with pictures being destroyed by robots
    on the back setting off bombs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an internal error occurred while generating a comment or
    description of something placed on the clipboard then it no longer interferes with the
    save. The text of the description may be incomplete however.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes occurred while describing a
    team of robots on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes robots on the back of pictures would stop working
    until you dropped the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if an earlier robot in a team failed to match
    because of the current value of a sensor and they were running on the back of a picture
    the team didn't wait for the sensor to change.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Put in better error checking if a sound comment was added to
    something and something was wrong with the sound.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot flipped over the remote looks of a picture it was
    on the back of, he sometimes stopped working right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading robots that were saved while they
    were running.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released version 2.02 and Beta 22.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta23"><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/1</font> </a>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some recent fixes to Marty made it so he didn't give advice
    unless called by the user.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug that can cause ToonTalk to
    crash while quitting.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the final puzzle file in a sequence contains just the name
    of an HTML file (.htm or .html) then the puzzle game is terminated and the user's web
    browser is launched on the file. Good for ending your own puzzle sequence.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with birds releasing things on the back of
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When training a robot to work on a box containing the
    &quot;containers&quot; sensor of a picture, it used to become a zero-hole box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem training a robot to work on a flipped picture
    where its parts disappeared during training.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where if a box with a
    picture in it was dropped into the hole of another box, then the size of the picture when
    taken of the box was set to the size of the box hole.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a member of a robot team flipped over the remote control
    for the looks of the picture where the robots are working on the back then sometimes the
    robots got confused.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is now more robust if a robot destroys a picture it is on
    the back of.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 3/28 that incorrectly optimized
    pictures that have been erased and given a new appearance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a sensor displays something that is not a picture (like
    the parts and container sensors) and the item is removed from the sensor it didn't behave
    as it should.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a minor bug in the processing of the FileSearchPath
    entry in toontalk.ini.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made more improvements to how ToonTalk behaves if a robot on
    the back of a picture destroys the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of training a robot to work on a box
    containing a picture with robots running on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the remote control for the looks of a picture is stopped
    then the picture is stopped as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The size of the remote control for the looks of a destroyed
    picture was improved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the reliability (but not accuracy) of dealing with
    objects that are smaller than a pixel.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you select multiple files in the Windows can copy them to
    the clipboard, then ToonTalk got confused.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented (but have yet to decide whether this is a
    documented fully supported feature) control-i as a way to turn things into infinite stacks
    - very much like the stacks in Tooly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to how ToonTalk behaves if a robot
    on the back of a picture destroys the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is moving on top of another picture and is added
    to a notebook the picture no longer moves while in the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow Dusty and the Magic Wand to select subpictures of an
    infinite stack.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was suspended or turned off it now is activated if
    necessary if a box is dropped on it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots can now be trained to type labels for other robots.
    Also can be trained to add labels to birds or nests.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a running robot was vacuumed up and then the
    city saved, the robot would start to run inside of Dusty.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way ToonTalk handles running robots that are
    destroyed. Sometimes robots would still run after they should have been destroyed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes Marty caused errors when describing why a robot
    stopped working.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a team of robots is destroyed while running
    (e.g. on the back of a picture that is destroyed) then some memory leaked.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way ToonTalk handles dropping something back on
    the stack it came from (or is identical to).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem putting force feedback effects into boxes.
    (Thanks to Ross for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sometimes loading a joystick sensor. (Thanks
    to Ross for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes robots on the back of pictures stopped running when
    you picked up the picture - no longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented control-g which toggles whether you can grasp
    something with your hand - Dusty works in either case. Good for gluing things down to the
    floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot running elsewhere ended up on the back of
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the internal handling of flipped pictures on the
    back of other pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop something on top of a stack and something else
    and the stack &quot;rejects&quot; it then only sometimes did the other object get a chance
    to accept the drop (e.g. go into a hole in a box).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of objects whose size is less than a
    pixel.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with matching force effects with force
    effects in a robot's thought bubble. (Thanks to Ross for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a similar problem for matching some kinds of sounds.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something went wrong while loading a city everything
    loaded prior to the problem is now added to the city.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the coordinates of objects saved in a
    city that are on the ground.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you saved a city while sitting on
    the ground, it didn't load back in properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when ToonTalk put up a dialog box to inform users
    of a serious problem the box was hidden under other windows.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes quitting after Dusty had erased things caused an
    error on exit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an error occurs while starting ToonTalk and you answer the
    dialog box saying you want to continue you no longer get more such dialog boxes.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk is told what language to use it now only checks
    the first few letters - e.g. &quot;port&quot; for Portuguese, &quot;eng&quot; for English,
    and &quot;swe&quot; or &quot;sve&quot; for Swedish.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If any section of a puzzle contained a line longer than 255
    characters, ToonTalk got confused. The limit is now 2048. (Thanks to Tiago for reporting
    this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty speaks while you are standing in a room, he is now
    a bit to the left so his talk balloon isn't clipped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Marty is speaking with a general text-to-speech engine
    (one that doesn't need to spell unknown words) then the first talk balloon was displayed
    for much too long.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed other problems synchronizing Marty's speech and his
    talk balloons.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle sequence ends in an HTML page (see 4/3 changes),
    then the default directory wasn't provided so it only worked reliably if a full path name
    was given.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you pick a demo, ToonTalk once again says &quot;OK&quot;</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the language is European Portuguese, then ToonTalk

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The nest of a long-distance bird can be copied or pasted (so
    long as it isn't pasted into another machine).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you exit ToonTalk after using long-distance birds,
    connections are released properly now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird flies to ToonTalk running on another
    computer and returns and then that ToonTalk is quit and restarted (and the nest was either
    saved in the city or pasted back in), then the bird will make a new connection and reach
    the nest again.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird is pasted into the same ToonTalk more
    than once, then each one shares the same connection to the nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird is given something and the computer
    where the nest isn't running ToonTalk, the bird will keep trying to connect.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird is pasted into the same ToonTalk as
    her nest, then the bird will fly directly to the nest and not fly through the network to
    the nest.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird receives lots of messages and can't
    deliver them just then, then she'll stop when the number of messages to deliver gets to be
    too many (currently around 50). And robots giving her things will also stop until the
    messages are delivered (e.g. because ToonTalk with the recipient nest was started).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced memory leak in the implementation

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to how Marty speaks numbers in

    see an egg in the nest only if no local birds of this nest exist.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various bugs in long-distance birds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a computer has more than one IP address - e.g. a modem and
    local area network - a bird will try both to get to the nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was using a tool like the wand while you were out
    of the room sometimes when you returned the wand was huge.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements as to how ToonTalk handles very
    large things (bigger than the screen).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flipped over a picture (or number or text pad) and
    took out its remote control for its looks and flipped the looks over and put the original
    on its back and then flipped it back over, an error was signaled. It no longer causes and
    error and also Marty now warns you that strange things may happen (e.g. partial
    duplication of things on the back). Thanks to Tiago for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Warnings for loading a networked nest saved with a different
    IP addresses than the computer currently has now deals properly with multiple IP

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the command line contains -debug_network 1 or the new

    network connections and messages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird is saved and her nest has been destroyed (e.g.
    dropped on the notebook) then she saves as if she has no nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird without a nest is given something it sometimes
    caused an error.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Resources were wasted if a long-distance bird delivered

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems that caused Marty's text balloons and

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes robots on the back of things

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you took a picture (or number or text pad) flipped it
    over, took out its remote control for its looks, flipped over the remote control and put
    the picture on the back then ToonTalk got very confused. Thanks to Tiago for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">For the last month, restoring cities or things on the floor
    of a room sometimes had things stuck to the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another bug introduced a month ago, that made robots
    saved while running on the floor not work right.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a ToonTalk with nests that receive things from
    long-distance birds is exited, it now breaks the connection with the computers with the
    birds properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Designed a new format for long-distance birds and their nests
    that takes up about 1/3 as much space and is easier to upgrade.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem that caused the
    text-to-speech system to signal an error while exiting ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where NT 4.0 didn't play
    sound effects. (Probably also applied to Windows 95 running DirectX 3.0.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The implementation of long-distance birds now handles things
    better if the ToonTalk holding their nest exits.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a team of robots would stop working (when watched)
    after one of them finishes when another should begin working.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with how Portuguese (both the European and
    Brazilian versions) handle '-' within words.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem receiving message from
    long-distance birds that wasted resources.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a nest had a label and something on top of it and was
    saved then when you pointed to the nest the label was displayed on top of what is on the
    nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When talk balloons have a different language than the one
    that Marty speaks they text and speech got out of synch badly (it still happens somewhat)
    and sometimes the talk balloons displayed for less than a second. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an imported picture is loaded into a computer without the
    BMP file and the picture had been saved with things on the back or front then strange
    things happened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the last puzzle file in a sequence is just a file name
    ending with 'htm' or 'html' then ToonTalk exited and displayed the HTML file before Marty
    was finished speaking. It now exits when you leave the rocket.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you double click on a puzzle file, ToonTalk is launched.
    Sometimes if you then ran 'Free Play' with the same user name the size and location of
    Tooly and his friends was wrong (and sometimes very very large).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you paused ToonTalk and while the dialog box was displayed
    double clicked on a TT file, then you lost the mouse cursor.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture or sound is imported with a full path name (e.g.
    starting with http://www... or c:\...) and ToonTalk can't find the file, it now searches
    for files using the 'FileSearchPath' entry in the 'Directories' section of toontalk.ini.
    It searches those directories for a file with the same short name and extension. Thanks to
    Miki for suggesting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Running robots sometimes didn't save so that when loaded
    again they would run without being started again by the programmer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Recent improvements to how Marty speaks numbers in European
    Portuguese now apply to Brazilian Portuguese as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if a robot is saved while it is waiting for a
    truck it sent off to build a house.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you loaded a networked nest (a nest with long-distance
    birds) into a ToonTalk and the Internet address is different from when it was saved, you
    no longer get a dialog box warning - just a warning in your log file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added error handling for processing incoming network messages
    so an error only results in a loss of a single message.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a text pad that had been flipped over on a
    notebook to jump to a page with some matching text it didn't work. Thanks to Miki and Ross
    for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a dropped a text pad that had been flipped over on an
    empty page of a notebook and then try to jump to that page by dropping a text pad it
    didn't work. Thanks to Miki and Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On some puzzles (those were Marty was expecting something
    that changes over time), Marty would sometimes start to say something and then interrupt
    himself and switch to saying the next thing.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped something containing a nest but none of its
    birds on a stack (in Tooly or a notebook for example), then the nest was converted to a
    networked nest (which wastes resources if it is only being used locally).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug saving cities while robots
    were running.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the remote looks of something was destroyed then the
    something was stopped. This even happened if the remote looks was from a sensor like
    &quot;Hit Who?&quot;. Thanks to Miki for reporting this. (Bug introduced on 4/7/00.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way Marty speaks of pictures with things on the
    front and back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that occurred when a picture had at least one
    picture with pictures on the front and the last thing on the back was removed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a performance bug with drawing objects whose width or
    height was longer than the screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now recovers from a DirectX draw error:
    &quot;DirectX front surface missing&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you clicked on the 'Leave ToonTalk' button holding
    something a Java applet was generated. Now only if you click on 'Come Back Later'.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something is glued you can now still type control-g to
    unglue it (or control-i to toggle whether it is a stack). This is part of what is still an
    &quot;undocumented feature&quot; (control-i and control-g) good for building neat cities.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now type control-i or control-g while holding Dusty
    to toggle glue or stackness of a picture that is a part of a picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot uses a wand in &quot;self-copying&quot; mode (S),
    the wand now copies the robot and any teammates. Great for recursion and mobile processes.
    When held it still just copies the wand (since you don't want more than one copy of
    yourself ;-)).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Self-copying by the wand, now animates like other copying
    with the copied item appearing attached to the wand.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copying a picture with text or number pads that are
    &quot;showing all&quot; no longer produces copies with the pads as &quot;show some&quot;.
    (The default is still to change to &quot;show some&quot; when added to a picture.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stacks of sounds now load properly (i.e. as stacks rather
    than as a single sound pad).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bomb goes off on the back of a picture that is inside a
    box on the back of a picture, then the whole thing isn't destroyed just the picture in the
    box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recent problem where text balloons showed part of a
    sentence sometimes when sitting down while Marty was talking. And Marty speech also was of
    parts of sentences.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now make a notebook blank so that it matches any
    notebook when in a thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a box is dropped on a blank notebook, the notebook is
    now filled with copies of the elements of each hole of the box.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Marty is speaking and showing a talk balloon which has a
    parenthetical remark that is split between 2 bubbles, then Marty sometimes would speak
    part of a word and then the other part when the balloon switched.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If text doesn't fit well in a talk balloon, the code to
    switch to a smaller font works better now.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Broke long-distance bird (fixed on 5/26).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Portuguese versions of ToonTalk can now speak
    &quot;&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Control-F8 which releases the mouse didn't work for old
    versions of DirectX - in particular this broke on NT 4.0.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak associated with use pictures (defined by
    BMP files).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">File to Picture (and pasting or dragging files) now accepts
    GIF, PNG, and JPG as well as BMP files. Note that this works only if Internet Explorer 4
    or later has been installed on the computer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you type to the top of a stack (e.g. in Tooly) then the
    key is sent to the top element of the stack. Previously it wasn't sent at all.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you press PageUp to have Marty repeat what he just said
    and he hasn't said anything then an error was signaled.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If robots are on the back of a picture that has been added as
    decoration to the roof or side of a house or wall of a room, then those robots only run if
    you the programmer are viewing the pictures they are controlling.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added to the Directories section of toontalk.ini
    &quot;URLCacheDir=&lt;directory name&gt;&quot;.&nbsp; If given a value, then when URLs are
    read they are cached in the specified directory. Used in conjunction with FileSearchPath,
    you can post media needed by games or other ToonTalk applications on the web and they are
    copied to a the URLCacheDir as needed. If this isn't set then the system Internet file
    cache is used. This has the advantage and disadvantage that files are automatically
    deleted when old and space is needed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added to the Directories section of toontalk.ini
    &quot;UserFiles=&lt;directory name&gt;&quot;. If given a value, then ToonTalk will look at
    the specified directory for user-specific files. These include changes to notebooks, saved
    cities, and the user customizations and profile. You can set this to a directory on a
    local file server, if children move between machines. Or it can be set to &quot;a:&quot;
    if the files should be kept on a floppy - making it easier to move between computers (say
    at home and at school).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sped up the loading of user pictures and sounds into
    ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem handling bad or missing user picture files.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of URLs for non-existent files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced a few months ago with some puzzles
    where Tooly appeared. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;File to Picture&quot; sensor when given a file name
    without an extension only tries to see if the file exists with &quot;.bmp&quot; added. (It
    no longer tries to add GIF, JPG, or PNG.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced a few months ago with Marty's talk
    balloons where sometimes sentences (or even) words were split between balloons. This also
    caused Marty to speak funny.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem in 'Play Game' when you
    walk back to the rocket and you left while Marty was talking.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots on the back of a picture in a box on the back of
    another picture didn't run when they should.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Brazilian Portuguese version now speaks numbers like
    &quot;1. 234. 567&quot; much better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where the first thing
    Marty says when you enter the rocket in 'Play Game' is confused if you didn't skip over
    the credits or let him finish with the credits.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk had a bug replaying very short recordings of 'Play
    Game'. DMO files less than 10K now work fine.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced a week ago where robots stopped
    running on the back of a picture if you put the picture in your pocket. This broke some
    puzzles near the end of &quot;Play Game&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with replaying recordings of using ToonTalk
    where Marty was speaking.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally ToonTalk's palette is replaced by one so the
    colors look wrong. This is automatically fixed in many cases now. If it still occurs,
    pausing and resuming ToonTalk should fix the problem.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes pressing PageUp (which makes Marty repeat the last
    thing he said) when Marty hasn't said anything caused an error.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a box is on the wall (as happens often inside the rocket
    in 'Play Game'), then the contents of the box became 'See Some' so text was visible but
    the pad it was on became invisible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving while a box is on the wall and the box
    has a sensor for the remote looks on the back. This is true of some of the later puzzles.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you load a picture with a transparent color (currently
    only GIF and PNG files support this), then that color will be invisible when the picture's
    visibility is set to 'See Some'. Unfortunately, the Microsoft API being used also makes
    cyan (100% red, 0% green, and 100% blue) invisible as well. If you need cyan and
    transparency then don't use a transparent color but use black for transparency (and very
    near black for when you need black). Or use a color near cyan.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some puzzles save the contents on the floor for use in later
    puzzles. If a bird was on the floor it became a network capable bird. No longer since this
    is wasteful and can lead to pauses.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk got confused when a robot was putting
    things on a nest while a bird was as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you pressed F7 (to hurry up the animation) while sitting
    down sometimes an error was triggered.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a sensor of a picture where the value of the
    sensor is text or a picture on the back of another picture, then the sensor displayed
    black though it seems it still worked.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem with the Portuguese
    versions of ToonTalk when &quot;&quot; occurred in a word.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way Marty spoke the time when written as
    &quot;3h45&quot; and the like.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally something that was under something else became
    on top just by standing up and sitting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk needs to put up a dialog box while it is
    initializing, then sometimes the dialog box was hidden beneath a window.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes after putting up a dialog box while initializing,
    the color palette was wrong until paused and resumed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird or nest is copied to the clipboard, the encoding no
    longer includes lots of general help information. This is so that it is easy to exchange
    networked birds by pasting into a chat or instant message system.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error handling if ToonTalk can't find necessary
    files when starting.</font></li>
</ol>

    non-BMP picture file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 23 released.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Brazilian Portuguese version of Marty can now speak
    &quot;:&quot;. (The other language versions still have this problem.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a text pad was dropped on the &quot;Text to Speech&quot;
    sensor the text was sent to the speech engine unprocessed. This typically caused problems
    speaking numbers using the ToonTalk provided voices.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem running robots on the back of pictures that
    have been trained to change Dusty's button.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot erased something and then tried to restore it, it
    used to only work if the robot was on the floor with you.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Java applet generator can now handled flipped picture
    with robots on the back of other pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Java applet generator now handles robot's whose name
    contains non-alphanumeric characters. E.g. space or new line.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Java applet generator now handles pictures with text on
    the back that contains non-alphanumeric characters.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced a new entry to the Network section of
    toontalk.ini. If LongDistanceBirds=0 then no attempt will be made to send or receive
    messages over the network.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where it displayed both the
    top item and the second to top item of a nest that is on a wall. Comes up in several
    puzzles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that broke the Java applet generator when
    dealing with the remote control for the looks of something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that broke the Java applet generator when
    dealing with a picture that has been erased and given a new appearance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that broke the Java applet generator if 2 or
    more robots had the same name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that broke the Java applet generator that
    sometimes occurred with many robots on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Since saving very large cities can take several seconds the
    cursor icon now changes to an hour glass while the save is in progress.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes in puzzles some objects on the floor floated above
    your hand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the way the Brazilian Portuguese version described
    the contents of boxes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the way the Brazilian Portuguese version speaks
    sentences contain ':' to only speak the colon only if the colon is quoted.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle #63 occasionally rejected a correct seconds timer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The display and speaking of numbers in Brazilian Portuguese
    now works correctly even if every three numbers are separated by &quot;. &quot;. E.g. 1.
    234. 567 is OK now.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the way the Brazilian Portuguese version displays and
    reads ordinals greater than 13. E.g. the equivalents of &quot;the 14th hole contains
    ...&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot has an attached tool (typically in puzzles) and
    used the space bar to turn the tool on then sometimes ToonTalk got confused. This broke
    puzzles 42, 62, and 63 and perhaps more.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Reduced the chances that the text in Marty's talk balloon
    will contain more lines than can fit.</font></li>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Non-beta versions without support for long-distance birds,
    signaled errors when loading in long-distance birds or nests.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where at the end of a
    puzzle sequence a dialog box warning of a missing puzzle file was displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you pause ToonTalk while flying the helicopter, and then
    resume, the sound of engine is resumed. (Not clear when this became broken.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk is paused it now releases access to audio and
    speech and restores this access when it restarts.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when Marty tried to describe Tooly the
    Toolbox.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems where Marty's speech and his talk
    balloons got out of synch when PageDown was pressed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty spoke whenever the text included 3 dots - now only if
    they are quoted. E.g. &quot;...&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that broke the animation of Marty teleporting
    in.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various problems Marty had describing notebooks that
    were in other things (e.g. boxes).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty describes what keyboard commands are available for
    a tool - e.g. SRE for Dusty the Vacuum he now displays with commas and spaces. E.g. S, R,
    E.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you saved a city while on the floor
    or ground and then loaded the city with a different screen resolution, your hand was too
    small or large for your arm. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made various improvements to what Marty said in the Brazilian
    Portuguese version.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you vacuumed up Tooly, left Dusty in another house or on
    the ground, and then sat down elsewhere,&nbsp; got up again, ToonTalk signaled an error.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a sentence doesn't fit in the talk balloon that Marty is
    speaking, a better sized font is used instead.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you finish the puzzle game, you can start over again now
    with the same user name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have solved all the puzzles and collide with Marty, he
    used to ask you to try again.</font></li>

    without a space between them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk signaled an error if Marty was displaying
    text while you stood up or sat down.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced 6/24 which prevented ToonTalk from
    loading birds saved by old versions of ToonTalk. This broke puzzle 42 and some later
    puzzles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Brazilian Portuguese version now replaces &quot;em
    o&quot; with &quot;no&quot; and &quot;em a&quot; with &quot;na&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made small improvement to the placement of text in Marty's
    talk balloon.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot's name started with a digit, then it didn't
    translate properly when converted to a Java applet.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the code behind a foreign bird (that flies to a
    &quot;DLL&quot; of Windows) wants Marty to say anything it also ends up in the user's log
    file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle sequence ends with the name of an HTML file, then
    that file is shown if the user quits after solving the previous puzzles</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are holding something in your hand and some other
    program interrupts ToonTalk, then a Java applet of what was in your hand was generated.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you vacuumed up a sensor and then
    spit it out it displayed the old value even if the thing it was sensing has changed.</font></li>

    position weren't quite right.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a generated Java comment referred to a name (of a robot,
    for example) that was on more than one line, it wouldn't compile correctly while
    generating a Java applet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets weren't generated correctly when a robot had a
    non-blank sensor in its thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when there were several flipped pictures on the
    back of a picture, the Java applet wasn't generated correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If copies of the same robot were part of the thing being
    turned into a Java applet, the applet didn't work right. To fix this the Java code no
    longer uses the robot's name but an internal ID number. The relationship between the
    robot's name and ID number is now provided by generated Java comments.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk generated incorrect Java code when a sensor showing

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now preserve the color of the text of a number.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now correctly translate pictures in thought
    bubbles whose &quot;Picture Number&quot; is other than zero.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another scheduling problem of when robots run in Java
    applets.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes signaled an error while
    quitting ToonTalk. Seemed to only happen in Windows 2000 when ToonTalk was putting up a
    dialog box upon exit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes an incorrect Java applet was generated for robots
    that used the Magic Wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Incorrect Java was sometimes produced if a comment was too
    long (more than 2048 characters long).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now behave correctly when a robot was trained to
    use the keyboard to change the state of Dusty (between suck, erase, and reverse).</font></li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying help while exiting if running on
    Windows 2000.</font></li>

    styles of numbers (e.g. &quot;2. 000&quot;) are encountered.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where text like &quot;1,000,000&quot; was
    broken after a comma.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading things that contain long-distance
    birds or nests in versions of ToonTalk where that feature is turned off.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with long-distance birds delivering things

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when Marty tried to describe a nest with
    long-distance birds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you placed an untrained robot in a truck with a box and
    then went to the new house and gave the robot the box, you didn't enter his thought
    bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a collision was mistakenly reported for brand new
    objects.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk didn't generate the correct Java code when
    generating an applet containing pictures imported by the user.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The text-to-speech sensor when it first received some text
    didn't always speak it properly.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added a new entry to the &quot;Switches&quot; section of
    toontalk.ini called &quot;ExclusiveMouseOK&quot;. If its value is 1, then ToonTalk will
    take exclusive control of the mouse software. It might make ToonTalk slightly more
    responsive and it should fix a problem running ToonTalk under emulators like Virtual PC
    and SoftWindows. Currently not recommended unless running in full-screen mode.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the Brazilian version of ToonTalk, Marty now speaks the

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes a robot on the back of a

    one known case - Poddy in the Playground city).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk can now generate a Java applet of a picture imported

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now automatically moves from the opening screen to

    &quot;DelayBetweenTitles&quot; in the Switches portion of toontalk.ini.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way labels on boxes are displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The puzzle game now works for birth years greater than 1999.
    You can return with either 2000 or 100 if you were born in 2000 for puzzle 16.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/22</font> 

<ol>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now use a Windows IME to type text to ToonTalk
    including Japanese (if you either have a Far East version of Windows or have set the
    default language of Windows 2000 to Japanese).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk displays multi-line variable width font text pads
    better.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you typed control-F8 while in full-screen mode very
    strange things happened. You now get a windowed version of ToonTalk and the mouse is
    released so you can, for example, drag pictures or sounds into ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you dragged things into ToonTalk, the objects appear in
    a box but the label of the box wasn't displayed properly.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you vacuumed up a box that a robot was working on then the

    for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with inputting single byte characters when
    the language was Japanese.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/26</font> 

<ol>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where random numbers from 0 to up to 1000
    were generated by Java applets and only up to 999 in ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The keyboard sensors now work more generally in Java applets.
    Arrow keys for example are now handled correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now use arrow keys instead of the mouse when running
    Java applets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs in the mouse button sensors in Java applets.</font></li>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When entering your name after starting ToonTalk, you can now
    have non-ASCII characters (e.g. Japanese) in your name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets running robots that copy pictures sometimes
    behaved incorrectly.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets that run robots that take things out of a
    pictures notebook of remote controls didn't behave right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented the parts and containers sensors for Java
    applets.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sensors in Java applets weren't always initialized properly
    so they had an incorrect value until the thing they were sensing changed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored the white backing on the variable width font text
    pads found in the built-in notebooks of ToonTalk since they are easier to read against a
    varied background and seem more &quot;object-like&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos made since 8/20 didn't work if the the system
    automatically moved between title screens.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes multi-lined variable width text pads were displayed
    with an incorrect distance between the lines.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The feedback provided when using an IME (Input Method Editor)
    didn't look good if the language was other than Japanese.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Keyboard events to turn on and off a picture weren't
    processed if the picture was erased. Thanks to Sarah Nathan for providing an example of
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a robot running on the back of a
    picture that flips over a different picture occasionally crashed. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Since 2/27 when a robot was given a box, ToonTalk first
    ensured that all pictures in that box were turned on. This was costly and not always
    desired so it no longer happens.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a picture with robots on the back was copied
    that the behaviors were turned off. (So some games like the new Playground adventure game
    didn't work after a scene change until the space bar was pressed.)&nbsp; Thanks to Jakob
    Tholander for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes prevented Marty from giving a
    warning that too many things were being displayed at once and some won't be seen (but are
    still there).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If too many things are on the screen at once, ToonTalk will
    now always show Marty and his talk balloon.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem after putting up a dialog box during
    initialization.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to how labels on boxes are
    displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while generating a Java applet reference is made to a file
    name which contains a back slash (\), the applet would not compile. It is now converted to
    a double back slash (\\).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made the speed of doing collision testing a bit faster.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;Hit Who?&quot; sensor (now called the
    &quot;Touching Who?&quot; sensor) no longer ignores what the programmer is holding in his
    or her hand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you dropped a picture or other item that looks like text
    on a blank text pad the blank pad is now converted the the text equivalent of what was
    dropped on top.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Removed spurious warnings of file not found when generating a
    Java applet containing user defined pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you clicked on 'See Demos' and then left the window with
    the demo choices open and then clicked on a TT, CTY, USR, or PZL file, nothing happened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping a picture on a notebook to jump to a page with that
    picture on it was broken for many months.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now drop a picture from a file on a notebook to jump
    to the matching page. Previously only built-in ToonTalk pictures worked.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/18 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that signaled an error sometimes when an element
    become very small (less than 1/10 of a pixel). Thanks to Jakob for providing an example.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Renamed the &quot;hit who?&quot; sensor to &quot;touching
    who?&quot; to avoid confusion about the symmetry of this sensor. If A is touching B then B
    is also touching A. The phrase &quot;hit who&quot; confused children who didn't think, for
    example, that the milk cartoon could be hitting a cat while they were fine with a cat
    hitting a milk cartoon.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A temporarily user can now add things to all notebooks except
    the main one (that lives inside of Tooly).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now train a robot to add pages to a notebook (except
    for the main notebook).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demo files didn't record the state of the shift and control
    keys and therefore didn't run properly if a sensor for the shift or control key was used
    in the demo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demo files can now be created that record input from the IME
    (Input Method Editor) including two byte characters, e.g. Japanese characters.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in recording demos that was introduced on
    June 14.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If control-F8 was pressed (the key for releasing or capturing
    the mouse) while recording a demo, it didn't replay correctly.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you used the keyboard to change an address (street or
    avenue), then the address was changed but sometimes continued to display the old value.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you type a page number to a notebook that is larger than
    the number of pages, then as before it goes to the last page. But it is now the case that
    if you then type a new page number it will respond.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes errors followed if ToonTalk put up a dialog box
    before it was finished initializing.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If network capable nest is in a notebook (or is on the back
    of a picture in a notebook), then when the notebook is opened to the page where the nest
    is, it became prepared to receive messages from long-distance birds. This shouldn't happen
    and was wasteful.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the performance of loading and saving large cities.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">While a large city is loading you now should always see the
    hour glass cursor.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you erase a notebook and copy it the new notebook is now
    also erased.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where spurious comments were generated in the
    Java code for an applet.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when a robot on the back of a picture, erases
    a number and drops a box on it. Thanks to Micke Kindborg for providing an example of this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when a robot on the back of a picture, erases
    a text or sound pad and drops something on it. (Broke the Bambi game.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of very large images (several times
    bigger than the screen).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem about spurious warnings in the log file about
    removing something from a background that couldn't find it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Small flipped pictures are now displayed much faster than
    before.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal better now with very tiny objects (smaller than a pixel)
    that have parts (e.g. picture on a picture). But there are still some problems where
    ToonTalk loses track of the relative size of these tiny objects.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the way ToonTalk generates Java when a robot copies
    something and drops the result on something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the way ToonTalk generates Java when a robot uses Dusty
    to erase something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A text pad that has been flipped and flipped back no longer
    flips again if you type 'f' to it. You need to use shift-mouse click (or right mouse if
    'Set Options' have been set accordingly).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot would get stuck that was trained to type
    something to a picture that has been erased and given a new appearance. Or is typing to a
    remote control for the looks of another picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way generated Java applets work when a picture
    is erased and another picture is dropped on top.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way generated Java applets work when a robot
    changes the button on Dusty and then uses him.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A minimum width and height now applies to all objects in
    ToonTalk. It is 1 pixel by 1 pixel when running at 640x480. And 2 by 2 at 1280x960. This
    should prevent problems where objects were nested several levels and when taken apart
    ToonTalk had lost track of their relative sizes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally Marty got confused and stayed around after
    saying good bye.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">And occasionally Marty got confused and left just after you
    called for him</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">And occasionally Marty would forget to say anything when
    called.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some sensors couldn't be turned on and off by typing space
    and stop ('.'). All sensors can be turned off now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes sensors were active and displayed the right value
    but didn't display an animated marquee to indicate that it is active.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the behavior of the language sensor that displays
    ToonTalk's current language setting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping a non-box on an erased notebook is still ignored but
    now a warning is put the user's log file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the warnings Marty gives if a picture file can't be
    found.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that signaled an error when something was
    dropped on an erased sensor that had no value (would have been showing black if it wasn't
    erased).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensors for the middle and right mouse buttons now tell
    the truth independent of how the mouse keyboard acceleration option was set in 'Set
    Options'.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a robot has been trained to vacuum
    something off a sensor and when run he gets mixed up about where to vacuum. Thanks to Ross
    for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Loading pictures or sounds from URLs caused ToonTalk to offer
    to display your log when you exited. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty only gives one warning about sending pictures or sounds
    when a user picture or sound is saved. The user's log lists all the files.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying multi-byte characters (e.g. Kanji)
    in subtitles. Sometimes several lines were displayed at once.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds loaded from files were saved in a way that only worked
    if the file was on the FileSearchPath in toontalk.ini.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk can now use shortcuts to files in the same way it
    uses the files. These can be local shortcuts (&quot;lnk&quot; extensions) or Internet
    shortcuts (&quot;url&quot; extensions). Shortcuts are typically created in the Windows
    user interface.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty now warns you about errors loading files at the most 3
    times. Subsequent warnings end up in the user's log file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you created a stack of pictures with things on the back
    and then pressed space while pointing to the stack, then the picture on top of the stack
    wouldn't always run correctly (or respond to tools like Dusty or Maggie).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when exiting ToonTalk in full screen mode and a
    dialog box needs to be displayed, ToonTalk was paused with the indication that it was
    interrupted by another program. The dialog box now just appears.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug (introduced in April) that caused a robot being
    watched to hold on to a bomb he sets off. This meant the house wasn't always destroyed and
    that the robot if spit out of Dusty would sometimes cause errors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensor that displays the language version of ToonTalk
    (e.g. English or Swedish) if saved turned off didn't turn back on properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a flipped picture is turned on (via the space bar), then
    any pictures which are face up on the back of that picture is activated. Even if those
    pictures are inside of boxes or other objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Blowing up a sound object no longer stops the sound. (Since
    otherwise an explosion sound would be cut off when the picture it was on the back of was
    destroyed.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made improvements to ToonTalk's handling of file links
    (shortcuts).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Double byte characters (e.g. Kanji) in Marty's thought bubble
    sometimes required one more line than there was room for in the balloon.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bammer now always smashes two things into one. Previously if
    the bottom thing was blank then the thing dropped was coerced to the type of the blank
    thing but both objects remained. For backwards compatibility, old robots and demos
    continue to work the old way.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several bugs in the Java applet generator especially
    when a robot has been trained to use the magic wand. The applet generator is more robust
    as a consequence of the above change since whether an object is destroyed by Bammer no
    longer depends upon run-time properties.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to ToonTalk's handling of objects
    that are smaller than a pixel.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made improvements to ToonTalk's handling of file links
    (shortcuts).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when Marty describes a robot in a box in a
    thought bubble. Was also a problem when generating comments when placed on the clipboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots running on the back of a picture now deal better with
    the geometry of tiny pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes after the second robot in a team ran he would move
    back and forth when the team was waiting for a sensor to change or a bird to arrive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed errors when Marty is describing something very long
    (over 10,000 characters) or the description is added to the clipboard as a comment. The
    description now ends with something like &quot;I've said enough.&quot;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made more progress saving and restoring with very tiny (sub
    pixel) objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems copying very small objects such that their
    relative geometry was preserved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that occurred sometimes when a robot was
    removed from a team and added to another.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sensors that can have non-rectangular pictures on them (e.g.
    &quot;touching who?&quot;, &quot;clipboard&quot;, &quot;file to picture&quot;) didn't
    display in a consistent manner. They now always show the background as something that
    changes from white to gray to black and back again. This is to emphasize their sensor
    nature, somewhat like how number and text valued sensors show an animated marquee.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you called for your notebook via F4 and then picked it up
    and dropped it, it flew off to its previous location. This was confusing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a demo was made that involved a notebook that contained a
    sensor for random numbers, then it didn't always replay correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where if something was
    dropped on some stacks the top item became very large.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot that vacuumed up his box caused spurious
    warnings to appear in the log file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Typing the arrow keys while a demo was running changed the
    value of the keyboard sensors and sometimes broke the demo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Typing arrow keys while recording a demo weren't recorded
    properly which made keyboard sensors misbehave.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where using the notebook of remote controls
    of a picture after having previously flipped the picture and erased it and replaced it
    with a new appearance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released Beta 24.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta25"><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/19</font> </a>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensors &quot;Touching Who?&quot;, &quot;Parts&quot;, and
    &quot;Containers&quot; now respond only to space and '.' from the keyboard to turn them on
    and off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The new animated background for some sensors now only
    animates when they are active.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of the animated background of some
    sensors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a file in Beta 24 that caused the manual to be
    displayed after solving 17 puzzles in Play Game.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally robots that were supposed to be running
    elsewhere appeared on the back of pictures or numbers. In particular this broke puzzle #62
    if puzzle 46 has been solved in the same session.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes robots from previous puzzles kept running
    unnecessarily.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem caused by something being destroyed (by
    robots setting off a bomb on the back) while still held in your hand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle sequence ends with a file containing the name of
    an HTML file, then ToonTalk as before ends the puzzle sequence and shows you the HTML file
    but it no longer offers to show you hints as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that caused the log file to contain spurious
    warnings about something already being part of a background.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is erased and a picture is dropped on it and
    then another picture is erased and the first picture is dropped on it, then chains formed
    internally that slowed things down and wasted memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem starting ToonTalk in a city that was
    saved when the programmer wasn't on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a couple memory leaks.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several more memory leaks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop a picture on a notebook, it now jumps to a
    matching page only if the picture you dropped has nothing on top or on the back. And it
    can't be flipped over either.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recent bug that caused some roof or house decoration
    to become very big.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the speed of loading pictures defined by user files.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed even more memory leaks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the time taken to check if something is equal when
    dropped on a stack if sensors are part of the object.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the performance when robots flip over the remote
    looks of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot creates more things than he did while training you
    now get a nice warning rather than an error.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Even more memory leaks found and fixed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem replaying demos at a resolution greater than
    640x480.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sometimes saving robots that in a robot's
    thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when a robot flips over more than one picture
    and uses the notebook of remote controls.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a robot on the floor is given a box and he fails to
    match due to the current value of sensors, then he now will run as soon as the sensor
    changes. Previously the robot might not notice the change for a while (or never if the
    change lasts a very short time).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The animation of robots on the floor waiting for sensors to
    change was improved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a notebook is shared by many robots (e.g. the
    notebook of remote controls of the picture that the robots are on the back of), the robots
    got mixed up and took the wrong thing from the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another memory leak.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if ToonTalk was customized so that Marty didn't use
    talk balloons (just spoke or displayed subtitles), then Marty would sometimes appear and
    not say anything.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems in creating demos when some of the geometry
    sensors were involved on the back of pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed even more memory leaks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recent problem with the notebook of sensors that
    happened sometimes when the picture they are sensing was destroyed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several problems be turning off the experimental
    feature added on 24/2 that pictures on the back of pictures run when the picture is
    flipped. You need to type space to turn them on now. This was also causing many spurious
    warnings from Marty.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when you flipped over a picture that was saved as
    flipped over on the back of another picture, then it became very big. Sometimes when you
    removed it from the back of the other and sometimes if you flipped it over.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem double clicking on a PZL file when the <a
    href="ttini.htm#SpokenLanguage">SpokenLanguage</a> feature is enabled (that permits
    ToonTalk to display text in one language and speak another).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various problems displaying very large boxes (with
    hundreds or thousands of holes).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Speed up the display of boxes that are partly off screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the Java applet generator when a robot has been trained
    to type space to the magic wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The puzzle game has recently been making a noise if you use
    the arrow keys.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Tooly and his friends now always go to standard locations
    when training a robot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 24b released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the generation of a Java applet when a robot was
    trained to press space to use the magic wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets sometimes when a
    flipped picture is on the back of another picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a picture with robots on the back that have been turned
    off is dropped on another picture, the robots are turned on if the underlying picture is
    on. (Used to be they were turned on regardless.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way a robot remembers space being pressed while
    holding a wand. It is now remembered the same as if the right button (if enabled) was used
    to turn it on. This new way is a little faster and produces clearer descriptions from
    Marty.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way generated Java applets work when a picture
    has a picture on top that has a robot on the back that sets off a bomb.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way generated Java applets work when a picture
    is destroyed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 10/23 that caused errors when
    robots were retrained.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Warnings about missing files now include the file extension.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When generating a Java applet of a ToonTalk creation that
    includes either user pictures or sounds, ToonTalk now looks at the same places (<a
    href="ttini.htm#FileSearchPath">FileSearchPath</a>) for the corresponding GIF or AU files
    that Java needs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way generated Java applets work when a robot
    matches a synthetic picture (e.g. rectangle or oval) with another kind of picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved how Java applets are generated when the remote

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way generated Java applets work when remote
    controls are turned on or off with space and '.'.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way generated Java applets work when a robot on
    the back of the remote looks for a picture sets of a bomb.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of pictures in boxes on the

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demo files weren't recorded properly when the mouse speed
    sensors were used and the arrow keys were used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demo files weren't recorded properly when a city containing
    remote controls for the random number sensor was loaded.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets when the nest of a

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping a picture that had been turned off into a box
    sometimes turned it on.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk appeared to freeze if you
    trained a robot after vacuuming up Tooly. (Thanks to Pierre-Andr Dreyfuss for reporting
    this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Time was wasted moving robots on the back of pictures that
    couldn't be seen.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Patch a leak that occasionally happened as robots ran (only
    observed during playing the puzzle game).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed other memory leaks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when starting on a puzzle (e.g. by double
    clicking on the puzzle file) that required you to jump back to an earlier puzzle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">At the end of a demo that solves puzzles, you no longer get a

    item on top was copied.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When running ToonTalk with a <a

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would give a warning about a number becoming to small
    or large when an inactive sensor or a blank number was involved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sensors now no longer function when the picture they are
    sensing is on the back of another picture. They also don't match anything other than
    erased things of the same type. Scales next to such sensors now totter.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copies of pictures with robots running on the back, sometimes
    the robots starting running before the process of copying was complete (and hence some
    sensors like position and parts weren't always correct). The copies now start running on
    the next cycle. Robots on the back of a picture that is being dropped on an erased picture
    now also wait a cycle before running. As do robots on the back of a picture when the
    picture is flipped back over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures with robots running on the back that are on a
    flipped picture that is in a box (or anything other than the back of another picture) no
    longer are activated when the containing picture is activated.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a remote control for the looks of a picture is flipped
    over, a copy of the things on the back of the original picture are placed on the back of
    the remote control. The overhead of doing the copy can be very high when the pictures are
    complex. So now when a robot on the back of a picture flips over the remote control for
    the looks of another picture the overhead of copying is avoided. (This makes scene
    changing in the Playground adventure game much faster as well as shooting in the Space
    Behaviors game.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a warning is produced before the titles are shown (e.g. a
    missing BMP or WAV file while loading a city), then Marty would appear and say nothing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a stack of pictures had a robot on the back that was using
    the &quot;selected&quot; sensor, then the sensor would take an extra cycle to work
    properly. (This caused the Playground &quot;speak my looks&quot; gadgets to require 2
    spaces to work.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a bird and nest on the back of different pictures where
    both pictures are back of another picture which is being copied then the bird thought that
    her nest was being copied and would deliver messages to both nests.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when Marty tried to describe a force feedback
    effect when effects haven't been loaded.</font></li>

    Introduced when arrow key handling was improved fairly recently. (Thanks to Pierre-Andr
    Dreyfuss for reporting this.)</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way robots work that have a nest next to a scale
    in the box they are working on.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applet source code now always includes a comment related
    the robot's name to the Java code.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Handle better the case where a robot is waiting for something
    to arrive on a nest and the nest is removed.</font></li>

    sensors in the Sensor notebook.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Empty text pads in boxes no longer get the width of the hole
    so that they are easier to visually distinguish from erased text pads. (Thanks to
    Pierre-Andr Dreyfuss for the suggestion.) Also zero-hole boxes in boxes are narrower
    than erased boxes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with Java applets when a robot used the magic
    wand on something on top of a nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Java generator now handles better ToonTalk sensors that
    don't make sense in Java (e.g. roof decoration or MCI).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets can now use the magic wand on erased pictures or

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a Java applet copied a picture with pictures on top, the

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets will not waste resources updating the display
    more than 100 times a second. (Which maybe is still higher than need be.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made various improvements to the sensor for the mouse's

    ToonTalk that Dusty and the other tools would disappear.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem (introduced in May) that caused birds to
    occassionally stop when flying on the back of pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a display problem with boxes introduced recently.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot working on a notebook would work with the
    notebook despite the fact that only the page numbers were visible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made improvements to the layout of things on the back of a
    picture so it is easier to pick up and looks better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a picture is destroyed (e.g. dropped in a
    notebook) the remote controls for its looks didn't become black rectangles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a picture is colliding with multiple things
    and is being destroyed (e.g. a bomb going off on the back) then an error was signaled.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The display of erased things sometimes did unnecessary extra
    work.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The notebook with the remote controls of a picture used to
    have notebooks for each part as well. This was very expensive in some cases. By default
    this is no longer the case. You can set &quot;CreateRemoteControlNotebooksForParts&quot;
    in the &quot;Switches&quot; section of toontalk.ini to restore the old behavior.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A complete rewrite of the way the sensor for the looks of a
    picture works was completed. Besides being much more lightweight internally you can now
    use the remote control to remove things from a picture (front or back). And you can flip
    over the sensor to see or manipulate the other side of a picture without flipping the
    picture over as well. And if the picture is flipped over the sensor isn't changed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem Marty had dealing with parenthetical remarks
    with the built-in speech engine.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now correctly copy things that contain bird/nest
    pairs so that they know about each other but not about the original versions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets had a bug dropping numbers on negative numbers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Speed up the copying of structures containing birds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally the size of a picture changed improperly if that
    picture had been erased and had another picture dropped on top and they held or selected
    while the keyboard is used.</font></li>
