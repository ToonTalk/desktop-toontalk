<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">On page 4 of your main notebook is a notebook full
of sensors. These are great for making things respond to the mouse and keyboard. There are
also sensors for measuring time, getting random numbers, and the address of the house.
Some sensors are for bringing in pictures, sounds, text, and ToonTalk objects from the
outside. Sensors work very much like the <a href="remote.htm">controllers for pictures</a>.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The sensors in the notebook are: </font>

<dl>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><strong>Page 2</strong> - Mouse's Right Speed </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This sensor measures how fast the computer's mouse
    (not <a href="bammer.htm">Bammer</a>) is moving from left to right. If it is negative the
    mouse is moving from right to left. A speed of 1000 means the mouse can cross the screen
    in 1 second. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><strong>Page 4</strong> - Mouse's Up Speed </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This sensor measures how fast the computer's mouse
    is moving up. If it is negative the mouse is moving down. A speed of 1000 means the mouse

  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This sensor answers the question, &quot;Was the left
    mouse button just pressed?&quot; If you press the left mouse button it'll switch from
    &quot;no&quot; to &quot;yes&quot; and then back to &quot;no&quot; again very quickly. But
    a robot can catch it and react to it being &quot;yes&quot;. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><strong>Page 8</strong> - Mouse's Middle Button

  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><strong>Page 18</strong> - Key Just Pressed </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This sensor shows the keyboard button that was just
    pushed. When you push a key, this sensor goes from blank, to showing the key, to blank
    again very quickly. A robot can be trained to catch the change. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><strong>Page 20</strong> - Last Keystroke </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This sensor answers the question &quot;What was the

  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><strong>Page 28</strong> - Number between 0 and 999 </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This sensor answers the question &quot;What is a
    number between 0 and 999?&quot; It tries its best to be <i>random</i>, like flipping a
    coin or tossing dice. If you want a copy of this that doesn't change drop it on a zero. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><a name="Clipboard"><strong>Page 30</strong> - To
    and from other Programs</a> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This sensor connects ToonTalk to the <a
    href="clpboard.htm"><i>clipboard</i></a> of Microsoft Windows. If you drop something on
    this sensor when it is empty (black), then Bammer will smash what you dropped into the
    clipboard. You can now go to some other Windows program like a mail program or word
    processor and select <i>Paste</i> from its menu (usually its <i>Edit</i> menu). The text
    that is pasted can be saved in files, sent by email, or whatever. When you want to go the
    other direction and bring something into ToonTalk from the outside then just select the
    text that ToonTalk generated and select <i>Copy</i> from the menu. The ToonTalk clipboard
    sensor will now show the object that was copied. You can use <a href="dusty.htm">Dusty</a>
    to remove it from the clipboard and then spit it out. You can also copy text into ToonTalk
    this way. Control-c to copy and control-v to paste are convenient keyboard shortcuts.</font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><a name="HandVisible"><strong>Page 32</strong> -
    Hand Visible? </a></font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This sensor answers the question, &quot;Is your hand
    visible?&quot;. You can press the space bar while pointing to or holding this sensor and
    you'll make your hand invisible if its visible or visible if its invisible. When playing a
    game like Ping Pong (on page 24 of the samples notebook on page 6 of your main notebook)
    you usually want to hide your hand. This is a good way to let robots do that for you when
    the game starts. Pushing F9 also hides your hand. Pushing it again shows it. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><a name="PictureFile"><strong>Page 34</strong> -
    File to Picture </a></font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This sensor converts file names into pictures. Just
    drop a text pad with the file name of a Windows BMP file onto the sensor and <a
    href="bammer.htm">Bammer</a> should smash it. If your picture file is in the ToonTalk
    &quot;users&quot; subdirectory or the <a href="ttini.htm#FileSearchPath">FileSearchPath</a>,
    then you can use just the short name of the file. </font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font
    size="3">You can then remove the picture using <a href="dusty.htm">Dusty</a>. You can make
    BMP files in lots of ways - the Paint Brush program included in Windows makes them. You
    can make the color black in your pictures transparent if you use the <a
    href="remote.htm#Visible">visibility controller</a> for your picture. The file name can be
    a URL like </font>http://www.toontalk.com/ghost.bmp. The file can be JPG, PNG, GIF, or DIB as well if the file name ends with &quot;.jpg&quot;,
    &quot;.jpeg&quot;, &quot;.png&quot;, &quot;.gif&quot;, or &quot;.dib&quot;.  If you load
    a picture with a transparent color (currently only GIF and PNG files support this), then
    that color will be invisible when the picture's <a href="remote.htm#Visible">visibility</a>
    is set to 'See Some'. Some GIF files with transparency that display properly in a browser
    will display in ToonTalk areas as white instead of transparent. Various programs will save these GIF
    files correctly. For example, reading and writing them into Adobe Photoshop fixes the
    problem. Also, unfortunately, the Microsoft API being used also makes cyan (100% red, 0%
    green, and 100% blue) invisible as well. If you need cyan and transparency then don't use
    a transparent color but use black for transparency (and very near black for when you need
    black). Or use a color near cyan. You can also bring pictures into ToonTalk by running
    ToonTalk in a window and then pressing control-F8 to release the mouse and then dragging
    files into the ToonTalk windows. Pressing control-F8 again restores the mouse. Or by
    copying the file name in the Windows Explorer and pasting it into ToonTalk.</font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><a name="SoundFile"><strong>Page 36</strong> - File
    to Sound </a></font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="3">This sensor converts file names into sounds.
    Just drop a text pad with the file name of a Windows WAV (sounds) file onto the sensor and
    <a href="bammer.htm">Bammer</a> should smash it. The sound will play until finished or you
    use <a href="dusty.htm">Dusty</a> to vacuum it off. You can get <a href="sound.htm">a
    sound pad</a> that you can use many times. Just vacuum it off the sensor and have Dusty
    spit it out. If your wave file is in the ToonTalk &quot;users&quot; subdirectory or the <a
    href="ttini.htm#FileSearchPath">FileSearchPath</a>, then you can use just the short name
    of the file. You can play a music file using the following MCI remote control. 
  The file name can be a URL like </font><a
    href="http://www.toontalk.com/noteD.wav">http://www.toontalk.com/noteD.wav</a>. You can
    also bring sounds into ToonTalk by running ToonTalk in a window and then pressing
    control-F8 to release the mouse and then dragging files into the ToonTalk windows.
    Pressing control-F8 again restores the mouse. Or by copying the file name in the Windows
    Explorer and pasting it into ToonTalk. </font></dd>

  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you drop a text pad on this sensor, the text is
    sent to <a href="mci.htm">Microsoft Window's Media Control Interface</a> (MCI). This is a
    general way to play different kinds of media. You can vacuum off the newly created <a
    href="sound.htm">sound pad</a> and use it like any sound. For example, dropping &quot;play
    c:\windows\media\canyon.mid&quot; on this controller will create a pad for playing the
    &quot;canyon.mid&quot; MIDI file. </font></dd>
