<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/1</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The bug fix of 12/30 dealing with time travel 
  and the sensor notebook broke old demos that were created using rerecording 
  where the sensor notebook had previously been opened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Various improvements to the way the installer 
  registers file extension handlers.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/2</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 3.134, 3.134X, and Beta 47.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="Beta48">Fixed a couple bugs in the new ability to drag 
  and drop links from web browsers into ToonTalk.</a></font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a serious bug in reading URLs that only 
  affected relatively large files (50 KB or so and greater).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dragged files (or a link) into ToonTalk 
  and you weren't sitting down the result was lost. Now it appears the next time 
  you sit down.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 3.135, 3.135X, and Beta 47b.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where you couldn't train a robot to 
  type a label for a nest, bird, flipped picture, or a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk crashed if Marty 
  tried to describe an untrained robot in a box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Greatly improved the error handling that might 
  be needed when ToonTalk is generating a description of something for Marty to 
  say.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a team of robots runs more than once within 
  the same cycle and they used a random number sensor then the sensor is updated 
  (i.e. changed to a new random number) each time the robots run.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where sometimes if a built-in 
  notebook is destroyed then pages of copies of that notebook were sometimes 
  clobbered. (E.g. a box gets zero holes, a text pad gets zero characters, 
  etc..)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In some cases ToonTalk crashed if you gave an 
  untrained robot a box with the remote control for the looks of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you pressed F1 while holding an untrained 
  robot then the robot's name became 'p' as well as Marty appearing and 
  describing the robot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you erase a truck with some cargo you no 
  longer see the cargo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 3.136 and 3.136X.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you type to a text pad very fast and then 
  rub out all the letters sometimes the text pad became invisible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if you train a robot with a sensor on 
  the back of a picture that is sensing the back of the same picture then 
  ToonTalk crashed when you gave the robot the box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If toontalk.ini specifies a folder for
  <a href="ttini.htm#UserFiles">UserFiles</a> that doesn't exist ToonTalk tries 
  to create the folder now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when you drop a truck in a box it 
  animated with strange sizes.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to add a label to a box 
  then when run he did so very slowly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the situations when warnings are 
  generated if a robot is manipulating the remote looks of a picture that has 
  been vacuumed up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a robot put a flipped picture on 
  the back of a flipped picture then sensors didn't change allegiance until the 
  picture is flipped or copied.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/6</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In unusual circumstances a picture was removed 
  by a robot or bird from the back of a picture but the picture still &quot;thought&quot; 
  it was on the back and acted confused.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/7</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed many problems introduced by the previous 
  bug fix.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 1/1 that broke 
  some old demos.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You no longer can drop a flipped picture on the 
  remote control for the looks of the front of a picture.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/8</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the parts sensor that 
  caused something to be destroyed twice (but other code prevented that from 
  doing harm). No longer generates spurious warnings.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that caused spurious warnings 
  about something being a part and not being a part.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Somehow a bird can leave a nest in a confused 
  state about whether its stack was returned or not. Happened once and not clear 
  how to reproduce but the nest is now fixed if this happens.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several more problems introduced by the 
  bug fix of 1/6.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped your main notebook on an erased 
  box then ToonTalk would often crash later.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when pictures with lots of tiny boxes 
  on the back were flipped a &quot;plop&quot; sound was played.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed two situations that can cause an object 
  to appear where ever you move on the floor and it can't be selected. Standing 
  up and sitting down fixed the problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the wording of some error messages.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot make heavy and frequent use of the 
  clipboard (or probably the file system as well using the file foreign bird 
  extension) then ToonTalk processed messages from Windows during the wrong 
  phase in its cycle. Two symptoms were keystrokes were lost and 'Come Back 
  Later' sometimes kept displaying on top of the desktop.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If flipped pictures with things on top, or a 
  truck with cargo, or certain sensors ended up in the box in a robot's thought 
  bubble they were very costly and served no function (other than provide 
  detailed objects if the box is copied).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the new toontalk.ini switch
  <a href="ttini.htm#RemoveUnneededThingsFromThoughBubbles">
  RemoveUnneededThingsFromThoughBubbles</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a very serious round off bug involving 
  fractions and the width and height sensors. For example, dropping -0.1 on 100 
  produced 99.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the parts and container sensors 
  weren't updated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A bug fix of 1/1 caused a crash loading a city 
  where the notebook of built-in sensors had been vacuumed up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that can cause a crash while 
  pasting an object into ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Trucks in boxes can now be erased and will 
  match any truck (normally trucks match only if their cargoes match).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Tiny boxes are displayed more efficiently now.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/12</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a robot took something out of a box 
  ToonTalk computed a &quot;good size&quot; for the object. Sometimes this is an expensive 
  operation (e.g. when it is a text pad with thousands of lines as can happen 
  with the ToonTalk to Excel tool when collecting data). The good size is now 
  only computed if the robot is being watched.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the picture of a remote control is vacuumed 
  up or destroyed then the sensor becomes blank. These sensors can now be 
  dropped on the back of other pictures and are restored to normal.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the remote control for the looks of 
  something if that something has been destroyed displayed with the wrong size 
  (bigger than the box hole for example). It now becomes blank and displays the 
  right size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 3.140 and 3.140X.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/14</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the ability to interrupt a lengthy 
  load of an object or city. (Experimental version only.)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/15</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You no longer get, what everyone agrees, is an 
  annoying interruption from Marty if you try to rubout an empty text pad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced new dialogs for interrupting the 
  loading or saving of cities or objects. And also interrupting the loading of 
  something from a URL over the Internet. (Experimental version only.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A space was missing in a message describing 
  numbers that are too big to display in decimal (several million digits).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/16</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Undid a change in how tiny boxes display that 
  was introduced in 3.140 since they are big enough to look empty when they 
  aren't.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to the new ability to 
  interrupt lengthy loads or saves.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/17</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in loading a city with sensors 
  with textual values that was created in a different language version of 
  ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with Marty speaking when 
  visiting a city saved while Marty was talking in a different language.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now ignores toontalk.ini files that 
  don't have a setting for MainDir. This is because uninstalling ToonTalk leaves 
  behind a version of toontalk.ini that contains only changes made subsequent to 
  installation and typically has too few settings to be usable.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The ClickMe.exe program that is run by autorun 
  when the product CD-ROM is inserted is now capable of supporting running 
  ToonTalk un-installed without putting up dialog screens. For this to work the 
  toontalk.ini file in the ToonTalk directory needs to have InstallCompleted set 
  to 1.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that interfered with robots in 
  other houses from using the decoration sensors to put pictures on the walls or 
  roof.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Inactive sensors for randomness or the 
  clipboard caused demos and time travel to sometimes replay incorrectly. Also 
  ToonTalk did unneeded work for inactive sensors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug related to the previous one that 
  occurred when the sensor had been erased, saved, and loaded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug related to the previous one that 
  occurred when the sensor vacuumed by Dusty and the city was saved and 
  restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes interfered with 
  replaying demos and time travel archives when the sensor notebook from page 4 
  was used. The fix only prevents the problem from occurring with new demos.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/18</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that can arise while exiting after 
  playing a time travel archive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that was caused by restoring a city 
  where the room decoration sensor is in a truck or being carried by a bird.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now displays how many objects have 
  been loaded when a large city or an object with many parts is loaded. Made 
  other improvements to the warning &quot;Loading, please wait&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/19</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When returning to ToonTalk after certain dialog 
  screens one sees the former location of your arm and hand for a short while.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/20</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The new toontalk.ini Switch 
  <a href="ttini.htm#RemoveUnneededThingsFromThoughtBubbles">RemoveUnneededThingsFromThoughtBubbles</a> was misspelled
  <a href="ttini.htm#RemoveUnneededThingsFromThoughtBubbles">
  RemoveUnneededThingsFromThoughBubbles</a> (without the last 't').</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another problem with robots using 
  decoration sensors while off screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug caused by dropping a box from the 
  Magic Wand by using the space bar on top of an untrained robot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug caused by dropping a box on a bird 
  and then dropping her nest into the box very soon afterwards.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to the new ability to 
  interrupt lengthy loads or saves.</font></li>
</ol>
</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/21</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem that generated 
  spurious warnings sometimes when a robot takes something off the top of a 
  stack on a nest while a bird is moving the stack around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Implemented the ability to drag and 
  drop DMO and CTY files into ToonTalk. Copying and pasting them works as well. 
  The DMO files don't replay correctly if recorded at a different screen 
  resolution. New demos are OK. Send <a href="mailto:kenkahn@toontalk.com">
  kenkahn@toontalk.com</a> email if you want to be able to drag and drop an old 
  DMO file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem pasting a house from 
  the clipboard if Bammer the Mouse had ever run in that house.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/23</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem that sometimes caused 
  a crash while exiting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem that sometimes 
  occurred when restoring a city where teams of robots were working on the 
  floor.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/24</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed some bugs that occur when 
  dragging a DMO file into ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a different bug caused by 
  dropping the name of a DMO file on the 'File to Object' sensor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Since demos typically don't run 
  correctly in a different screen resolution than when they were recorded, 
  ToonTalk now switches resolution if needed to run a DMO file in an already 
  running ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a demo is run in an already running 
  ToonTalk when it is over or exited you are returned to the city as it was just 
  before the demo started.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug in loading a notebook that 
  had been saved more than once that caused it not to include all the included 
  user media files when saved. Note that the problem didn't affect new 
  notebooks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes after certain events when 
  running ToonTalk in a window, ToonTalk made the window &quot;topmost&quot; in a way that 
  caused it to stay on top of other windows. Now it still goes to the top of 
  other windows but won't stay there if another window is selected.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/25</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem that sometimes caused 
  ToonTalk to crash while exiting after running someone else's time travel 
  archive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.141 and 3.141X.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug that caused the 
  experimental version of ToonTalk to crash when a TT file is clicked on unless 
  ToonTalk is already running.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.142X.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fix a bug that caused &quot;ghosts&quot; of old 
  subtitles and the programmer's arm to remain after loading something into the 
  experimental version of ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the feedback when loading in 
  the experimental version.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.143X.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/26</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug that caused a crash while 
  exiting after playing a time travel demo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where the room 
  decoration sensor could get &quot;lost&quot; (e.g. being pasted or in a truck outside) 
  can cause a crash. Also when &quot;lost&quot; it no longer keeps the appearance of the 
  previous house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a picture with a robot with a 
  generated name on the back is removed from a notebook and then dropped right 
  back down it didn't return to the stack.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if a picture was on a glued 
  down picture and you stood up the picture was displayed as if it were under 
  the glued down picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now double click on a DMO or 
  CTY file while ToonTalk is running and it'll respond.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you changed the button on a tool 
  using the keyboard then sometimes ToonTalk spoke the wrong description.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Made ToonTalk recover from errors if 
  they occur while 
  trying to play a user defined sound.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/27</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed another bug that caused a crash while 
  exiting after playing a time travel demo.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk would 
  erroneously receive a system message to quit and then crash while trying to 
  quit at an inappropriate time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where the sensors in 
  the Options notebook weren't initialized properly. For example, it always 
  showed 'Bald' initially.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.144 and 3.144X.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/29</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When loading a URL (to a remote file) 
  into ToonTalk the experimental version now displays progress and makes it 
  clear when interruptions are possible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a performance bug where 
  sometimes a URL was read twice.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a memory leak in loading URLs 
  over the network.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">On 11/25 restored the ability to 
  remove a value from the Touching Who? sensor and if touching more than one 
  thing to be able to cycle through all of them. This introduced a bug in 
  &quot;uncollide&quot; where sometimes ToonTalk froze. Also it missed some of the things 
  being touched when part of a picture (it didn't missing anything if the 
  picture was on the floor).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/30</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk crashed 
  after returning from 'Save to File' if the thing being saved contained very 
  large user pictures. (Very large is where the raw version of the images was at 
  least 1% of the physical memory of the machine.) I think this bug may also be 
  triggered by displaying multiple copies of the same large picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The fix of 1/24 where notebooks of 
  user media didn't always save with the media files didn't cover all cases. 
  Fixed now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The fix on 1/26 for glued pictures 
  sometimes made the programmer character walk in front or behind things 
  incorrectly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed the underlying cause of the bug 
  in the experimental version that was introduced with 3.141X and fixed on 1/27 
  where system messages seemed to be arriving indicating ToonTalk should quit. 
  Also this restored the ability to exit from ToonTalk while loading something 
  large.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem introduced on 1/27 
  that caused some old demos to not replay correctly (e.g. act 2 of the Pong 
  demo).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.145 and 3.145X.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/31</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced in 3.145 that 
  caused &quot;uncollide&quot; to not function.</font></li>
  <li><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes a team of robots on the back 
  of a picture would forget they were running until the picture was dropped or 
  space typed to it.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.146 and 3.146X.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">2/1</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The new ability to drag and drop from 
  a web browser interfered with drag and drop of an attachment from a mail 
  message. Both work now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You once again can drop a team of 
  robots or a notebook on an erased number pad to compute the size of the team 
  or number of pages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You couldn't type 0 in bases other 
  than 10.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem introduced with 3.140 
  that sometimes caused ToonTalk to freeze when there is a parts sensor for the 
  back of a picture that is on the back of the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you clicked on help URLs in a 
  dialog (e.g. the one explaining time travel when asking your name) then the 
  browser was usually underneath the dialog. The dialog window now minimizes 
  when reading help files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">'Set Options' now offers 'Advanced 
  Options' which enables the setting of all toontalk.ini options.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">2/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Updated and enhanced some of the HTML 
  documentation.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.147 and 3.147X.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when standing up or leaving 
  a room with robots working the items on the floor have the wrong size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If toontalk.ini does not have an entry 
  then an internal default value is used. That value is now written to the 
  toontalk.ini file so that the default is easily to see and change.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed problems that occur when a robot 
  was trained to use Pumpy and is running off screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where if a robot was 
  trained type control-v it suspended if it was off screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.148 and 3.148X.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">2/3</font></p>
<ol>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where sometimes if a bird 
  and copy of her original nest were saved together then when restored 
  additional copies of her nest were not noticed by the bird. Fixed it both so

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed the dialog that is shown when

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem introduced with 3.161

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if a robot flipped through 
  the pages of a built-in notebook on more than 32K cycles then ToonTalk ran out

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The <a href="remote.htm#XSensor">
  position sensors</a> for pictures used to only display integer values. Then in 
  2002 a new feature was introduced to optionally display the value as an exact

  ToonTalk is now consistent and you can change the default from showing integer

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes (e.g. when a bird's nest is 
  in a box that another bird is taking to its nest) a box became a &quot;screen

  disappear when you stood up and sat down. Such boxes are displayed correctly 
  now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">On some systems after a crash ToonTalk

  the placement of things dropped by robots.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If while in window mode you press 
  Alt-Tab or otherwise cause another window to be selected and ToonTalk is 
  loading a file then it continues to load and doesn't display anything until 
  the ToonTalk window is selected again.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">6/6</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.169 and 3.169X</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when a robot drops a picture 
  on something the position sensors for the picture aren't updated correctly 
  until the next cycle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If something is glued down and on the 
  ground you can walk over it now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if you saved a city while 
  holding a picture bigger than the screen then when the city was restored you 
  were still holding the picture but it was displayed in the wrong place (even 
  off screen).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed an additional problem generating 
  applets whose &quot;name&quot; contains non-alphanumeric characters.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">6/14</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot dropped a nest on a nest 
  then it hung if watched.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty gives a warning if you attempt 
  to give a bird something containing her nest. This now applies if the bird's 
  nest has been bammed onto a nest contained in that something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Under rather special circumstances if 
  you tried to train a robot to give something to the bird, the bird didn't fly 
  off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you give something to a bird whose 
  nest is on the back of a picture that has been turned off then sometimes the 
  bird refused it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Made further improvements to where 
  robots drop things on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Under special circumstances ToonTalk 
  crashed when a picture with things on the back was destroyed because a 
  vacuum's &quot;stomach size&quot; has been exceeded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot was trained to type '.' 
  while holding or pointing to 
  the remote control for the looks of a picture and the robot was on the back of 
  that picture, then the picture was 
  turned off next time it was flipped rather than when the robot typed the '.'.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If no name is given in the dialog 
  asking for a name then the empty string was used leading to confusion. Now a 
  &quot;No Name&quot; name is used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if a user uses the &quot;No Name&quot; 
  name then the name was converted to the user name of the last demo run.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.171X (3.170 was a special 
  release).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">6/16</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes Java applets stopped when 
  trying to compute something to a negative power.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Some operations on floating point 
  numbers truncated them to integers. So, for example, .9+.9+.9 would be 0.0.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes&nbsp; a bird flying to a 
  nest on the back of a picture held by the programmer as he or she stands up 
  ended up &quot;stuck in limbo&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you dropped a text or number pad on 
  an erased picture the resulting pad could cause a crash when operated upon or 
  saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you have a picture with birds and 
  nests on the back and click on 'Edit Picture' in the Pause dialog then the 
  edited copy has birds and nests that are not new pairs but connect to the 
  birds and nests of the original. Now it acts just like using Maggie the Magic 
  Wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.172X.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Displaying very tiny numbers sometimes 
  computed a negative width font -- apparently harmless but wasteful.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if a number was very small 
  (visually) inside of something and became larger then only the first one or 
  few digits were displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Dropping a number displayed as a 
  fraction on an erased text pad sometimes resulting in a text pad with the 
  decimal representation of that number.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug in saying numbers in 
  languages with non-ASCII characters -- e.g. Portuguese bilies were the  was 
  replaced with a non-character.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/6</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a very tiny bird (less than a 
  pixel) was carrying something it sometimes was displayed incorrectly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">A robot trained to give its box to a 
  bird sometimes got confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot gave a bird something and 
  there were multiple nests the robot proceeded when the first bird copy 
  returned rather than when the last one did.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot flipped through a notebook 
  off screen then if that notebook was sent off in a box it was on the wrong 
  page.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/7</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Boxes displayed on the wall of the

</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/8</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when a bird starts flying 
  from off screen its animation to a good size was delayed until seen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when Marty is speaking and 
  then the programmer leaves, he waits until the programmer returns to teleport 
  out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes Marty disappeared when 
  saying something (with speech and subtitles enabled).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed bug caused by running a robot on 
  the floor that had been trained to drop its box in a truck which caused a 
  warning about something being destroyed that was on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When a robot was trained to drop part 
  of its box (&quot;My Box&quot;) in a truck then it didn't switch to considering the 
  remaining part as its box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot was running off screen and 
  dropped a robot on another robot then the action was incorrectly suspended 
  until you visited that house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot running off screen put a 
  team of robots in a box then the robots were too small for the box and if 
  there were many some were displayed outside the box hole.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem computing the size of 
  things in boxes when the hole is very tiny.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When a truck was in a box you 
  sometimes could select and grab the cargo and sometimes not.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem with a bomb going off 
  in another house that occasionally caused ToonTalk to crash.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Pasting a fully loaded truck while on 
  the ground outside caused ToonTalk to crash.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot gives something to a robot 
  that it can't accept the robot now stops and Marty reports what happened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Introduced a new (default) mode for 
  Marty.&nbsp; If <a href="ttini.htm#MartyAppearsOnlyIfCalled">
  MartyAppearsOnlyIfCalled</a> is set then when Marty wants to say something an 
  icon appears and lasts
  <a href="ttini.htm#MartyHasSomethingToSayDisplayDuration">
  MartyHasSomethingToSayDisplayDuration</a> seconds before going away and 
  forgetting what it was he wanted to say. If before the icon disappears one 
  presses the F1 key then Marty will say then what he currently says when 
  triggered by an event.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem replaying demos 
  correctly that didn't start from a saved city (directly or via DefaultUser).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty didn't greet you if you managed 
  to walk into a house very quickly from the usual start flying in the 
  helicopter.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Numbers constrained to a tall narrow 
  space displayed poorly. This included when on top of a nest on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you took out any of the decoration 
  sensors (roof, front wall, room) out of a box they didn't grow to a good size 
  (nor did using Pumpy make them grow to a good size).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem that dropping a box on 
  a team of robots on the ground sometimes caused a crash while generating a 
  warning.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when calling for Dusty 
  quickly (using F2 twice) the selection was not the tip of his nose.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Using Pumpy to make something Narrower 
  or Wider didn't do anything if the object was very wide (e.g. 30,000 normal 
  sized digits).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If interruptions for a particular kind 
  of trouble shooting had been turned off, then the log file now explains how to 
  restore the old behavior.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/6</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If an object was made invisible and 
  then flipped over the image flickered.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.174X and Beta 49.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">10/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced on 5/13 that 
  affected integers greater than 2^31 (about 2 billion) that had been 
  non-integers. (E.g. 1/3 that was later multiplied by 300000000000) The number 
  displayed with a final decimal point (or as a fraction displayed as n/1). If 
  you edited such a number (e.g. tried to rubout the decimal point, then the 
  number was incorrect).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When </font><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"> <a href="ttini.htm#MartyAppearsOnlyIfCalled">
  MartyAppearsOnlyIfCalled</a> is set then Marty said the right things but then 
  acted as if you called for him to explain the thing you were holding or 
  pointing to.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The StartTT.exe now does additional 
  error checking if the initial dialog HTML file is missing and puts up a dialog 
  box rather than just silently terminating. (One way this arises is if two 
  different language versions are installed that customized the content of the 
  opening dialog.)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">10/20</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a system is configured so that some 
  of the special folders (e.g. My Documents or Shared Documents) is a drive 
  (e.g. d:\) then ToonTalk had troubles storing files.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">11/1</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If something was saved that contained 
  a picture on top of a nest and sensors for that picture then half the time 
  when saved it did not load properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Resuming the puzzle game when on the 
  previous session the last puzzle involved a bird that whose nest is put on the 
  rocket's wall sometimes led to crashes for that user name. This particular bug 
  was fixed and error handling for loading in the user profile was enhanced.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you dropped a sensor for the 
  horizontal or vertical position on an ordinary integer you typically got the 
  correct answer plus some fraction.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you typed an operation (e.g. / or 
  =) to a numeric sensor then there was no way to restore it. Now sensors turn 
  off when they become an operation. Sensor that are off can be edited using the 
  arrow keys.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.175X.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">11/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The bug fixed on 11/1 where a 
  non-integer resulted from adding an integer sensor to an integer didn't work 
  if the addition was off screen.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">11/7</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The bug fixed on 11/3 </font><big>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">where a non-integer resulted from adding 
  an integer sensor to an integer caused other instances of that sensor to have 
  its value change by a fraction.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">A sensor that was made was changed to 
  be an operation (see fix 4 on 11/1), did not save correctly so when restored 
  the operation was lost.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">11/8</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When </font><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"> <a href="ttini.htm#MartyAppearsOnlyIfCalled">
  MartyAppearsOnlyIfCalled</a> is set then the Marty &quot;icon&quot; now disappears after 
  15 seconds rather than 30. And when it disappears the text he was going to say 
  goes away. Previously if you called for Marty he first said something he 
  wanted to say that may have been very old.</font></big></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty no longer says some introduction 
  about how he may be hard to understand when a new user is first greeted. (This 
  was a hold over from early poor quality text-to-speech engines.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where if a number on 
  the ground or floor is made too tall then font becomes small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed several problems displaying 
  fractions where the numerator or denominator is partly off the left edge of 
  the screen. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where fractions whose 
  numerator and denominator are the same length but displayed with slightly 
  different font sizes so that the alignment was lost.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If after a trouble shooting warning 
  was displayed an the option was checked to not interrupt again for this 
  problem or warning then many copies of the warning could end up in the user 
  log file. Now only the first occurrence is logged.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.179X. (3.176X to 3.178X 
  were released only to Gordon.)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">11/16</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced in April that 
  prevented old format cities (pre-XML) from loading.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug that prevented the 
  retraining of a robot that took things off the back of a remote looks sensor 
  (and the touches who) sensor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If the file for the icon that Marty 
  wants to say something was missing then ToonTalk crashed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The fix introduced on 11/8 made Marty 
  forget important warnings and error messages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a picture had been flipped over and 
  then was Bammed with another, ToonTalk wastefully saved the notebooks of 
  remote controls for those pictures, in order to implement unbamming.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you moved your hand enough to cause 
  the camera to follow while Tooly is settling down then sometimes his contents 
  were shifted. They still are but after a second or two they go to the right 
  places.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling if a USR 
  file has been damaged.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.180. (Stopped using X for 
  experimental.)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">11/22</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced in 3.180 that 
  caused demos and time travel archives to be saved incorrectly. These faulty 
  files can be read by 3.181 and later but not earlier versions. And faulty 
  files are no longer produced.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug displaying boxes with the 
  correct size when on the ground and seen from high above the city.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where birds left on the 
  ground changed their size when seen from the helicopter.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where if you pressed F2, 
  F3, or F5 (once or twice) while Tooly is still opening up then the tools 
  sometimes ended up in your hand but in a confused state.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">While fixing a bug on 11/8 made 
  shrinking digits have too narrow a width and hence looked bad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Ellipses displayed incorrectly if 
  partially off screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty could cause a crash when 
  entering a house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when you entered a house you 
  heard the sound of Marty beaming in but he didn't.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a display bug where sometimes 
  doing an operation on a very large number created a number that displayed the 
  first few digits followed by ...</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where while standing 
  something on the floor is displayed on top of Tooly the Toolbox.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a WAVE file is imported as a user

  off a compressed sound doesn't work. Note that for a long time now WAVE files 
  that are compressed can be used as narration to demos.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.182 and Beta 50 (delayed

  <li><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Generated a version of ToonTalk 
  only for running programs -- no robot training. Will be freely distributable.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem starting new demos

  caused by dragging a DMO file to ToonTalk while it is paused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the warning produced if
