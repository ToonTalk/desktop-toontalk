<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/9/2001</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now work correctly if a bomb taken out of a box
    and used.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug generating a Java applet when a notebook with an
    empty page was involved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating a Java applet of a robot that has
    a remote control for the looks of a picture in its box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with a spurious warning when you quit
    ToonTalk while a robot on the floor was holding a magic wand.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the notion of a local &quot;ini&quot; file that
    looks just like a <a href="ttini.htm">toontalk.ini</a> file. When ToonTalk is started by
    clicking on a TT, CTY, or DMO file then it looks for a file with the same name and with
    the extension INI and uses any entries there to override the defaults in toontalk.ini. So,
    for example, a TT file can set the <a href="ttini.htm#FileSearchPath">FileSearchPath</a>
    to indicate where to find needed pictures and sounds on the web.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes producing a warning while
    ToonTalk is started caused an error.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error handling when an attempt to read a URL
    fails.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you double click on a CTY file and
    give your name, the main notebook shows the city's name not yours.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem with erased pictures that have had a
    picture dropped on them that caused errors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying some things that are exactly at
    the minimum size (1 pixel at 640x480 screen resolution).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem dealing with toontalk.ini entries that are
    numbers greater than 64K.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets sometimes started to run before fully
    initializing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now work correctly if an erased picture is
    matched against an erased picture that a number or text pad has been dropped on.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes describing a nest with things
    on it caused an error.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem describing something with parts that are
    ignored but would require a long description (over 2000 characters long).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes dropping something on the remote control for the
    looks of something X ended up showing that thing under rather on top of X.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A warning is now given if you try to make a Java applet of
    something that uses sensors that don't work in Java (e.g. the joystick sensors).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the page number was displayed
    too large and at the wrong place if the notebook is too small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to the display of objects at the
    minimum size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now work better if they contain a sensor that
    can't work in Java (e.g. a joystick sensor). (Though they can't work as well as one would
    like of course.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now generate Java applets that use the magic wand to
    copy self - e.g. the robot holding the wand. (This happens when the Wand's button is
    displaying 'S'.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way you can train robots to use the wand to copy
    themselves. (Good way to express recursion.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk is reading something over the Internet, a message
    asking you to wait while it fetches the file is now displayed. And if running in
    full-screen this message appears as a subtitle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture included lots of pictures or sounds that are
    being fetched over the Internet, then the mouse appeared to freeze (if running in a
    window).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes resources for reading URLs were not released after
    the file was read.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk was fetching the notebook of remote controls,
    it sometimes spent time looking for files using the <a href="ttini.htm#FileSearchPath">FileSearchPath</a>
    (which if it includes URLs can be very slow.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Simplified Java applets of pictures that involve birds who
    don't have nests or whose nest isn't on the back of the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of birds flying to nests on the back of
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the matching of sensors that show pictures with
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now remove everything from the back of a picture by
    erasing its sensor that shows its parts. The sensor can be flipped to show the parts on
    the back and then Dusty can erase them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots can now be trained to flip some remote controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the remote control for the looks of a
    text pad, displayed wrong if it was very small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the animation of ToonTalk built-in animations when
    running as a Java applet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem reading the 'Delete' key in generated Java
    applets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now see the pictures on top of an invisible picture
    in Java applets.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you attempted to put a room or house on the clipboard and
    the encoding was larger than 32,000 then it didn't work. The limit is now 2,000,000 bytes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem putting a house on the clipboard when robots
    were working inside.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with how erased remote controls that display
    pictures used in boxes in thought bubbles matched things.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the name of robot was
    displayed at the wrong place.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk couldn't find the corresponding GIF or AU file
    for a BMP or WAV while generating a Java applet a dialog box reporting the problem was
    displayed. The warning is now placed in your log file and ToonTalk offers to display the
    log file when you quit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sitting on the floor when an entire city has
    been placed on the clipboard (by typing control-c when walking outside).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now display correctly changes to the appearance
    of something that was dropped on an erased picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of scales in Java applets when
    something next to them is erased.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the handling of scales in Java applets when used to
    compare pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of the dropping of a team of robots on
    an erased box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems erasing the remote control for the parts
    of something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to change the page number of the main
    notebook then sometimes when he repeated the notebook wasn't turned back to page 1. (Note
    this only applies to the main notebook since robots are trained with it on page 1 - other
    notebooks aren't automatically reset to page 1.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of box labels.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when something was dropped on the remote
    looks for a picture and they were showing different sides.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 12/19 loading the remote looks
    of things.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty no longer produces warnings about a robot somewhere
    stopping due to a mismatch of his thought bubble and box when running the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes caused an error while quitting
    ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets that occurs sometimes
    when a robot was trained to use Dusty to spit out something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem caused by a robot vacuuming something
    up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling in Java applets of the remote control
    for the looks of something being dropped on an erased picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with Java applets of robots who change the
    button on the magic wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved and generalized the way Java applets work of robots
    who find things on the back of a picture. And such robots can now remove things from the
    back of pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem training a robot to flip over a remote
    control for the parts of a picture (and other such remote controls).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling in Java applets of notebooks with empty
    pages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can now generate a Java applet of a robot with an erased
    notebook in his thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 12/18 where sometimes when
    pictures are copied the copy comes out flipped over when the original isn't.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the matching of flipped pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A number on the back of a picture sometimes interfered with
    turning the picture into a Java applet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the robustness of robots that flip things over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now work correctly when a text or number pad is
    dropped on an erased picture and the result is dropped on a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets can now remove or add something to a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now support the erasing of the parts sensor of a
    flipped picture to remove all items from the back.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some memory leaks in the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the wording of the warning that occurs when not
    enough memory is available for caching sounds in memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak when Marty speaks in one language and
    displays in another.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the robustness of Marty displaying double-byte
    characters (e.g. Japanese).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak when training a robot with a box
    containing pictures that had been erased and had another picture dropped on them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made the dropping of something on the back of a flipped
    picture more robust.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of the remote control for the looks
    when it is flipped and the thing it is controls isn't.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where an error can occur if the clipboard
    contains something that is only 1 or 2 characters long.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now work correctly if something is dropped on
    the flipped remote control for the looks of something.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the Java code when a robot uses Dusty or the magic
    wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Generalized the way Java code finds things on the back of
    pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When producing a Java applet from a picture, ToonTalk will
    name the applet the same as the first text pad it finds on the back that is less than 32
    characters long (was 31 earlier). It also deals better with the situation when there are
    more than one text pad on the back that is less than 32 characters long. The most recently
    added one should be chosen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets when a flipped
    picture defined by a user file is involved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Began changing the Java applets to preserve the same
    structure of flipped picture on the back of flipped pictures that is found in ToonTalk.
    Previously every robot ran as if it were on the &quot;top level&quot; of the back of a
    picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture blows up in a Java applet then any robots
    running on the back of pictures associated with that picture also stop. For example,
    robots running on the back of a picture in a box that is on the back of the blown up
    picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 12/22/00 that fixed the size of
    text pads that had been flipped over. Once again they change size as you type to them
    (unless they are in a box or the like). Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Worked around a limitation of Java that prevented complex
    pictures for working (when the compiled code to initialize them exceeded 64K).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved Java applets handling of &quot;global&quot; sensor
    like time, keyboard, and mouse.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">31/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 10/13/00 that caused errors
    when a notebook is dropped on an erased box (to coerce it to a box with a page in each
    hole).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when dropping a notebook with empty pages on
    an erased box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of the main notebook in Java applets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the generation of Java applets of a robot (as
    opposed to a picture with robots on the back).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the information left in the Java log file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a Java applet has a robot dropping something on a box with
    no holes or on a non-existent hole then the team that robot is part of is stopped but the
    applet is no longer stopped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets can run robots that drop boxes on erased
    notebooks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets can run robots that drop notebooks on erased
    boxes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets can run robots that turn on and off pictures
    using ' ' and '.'.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Starting on 10/24/99 ToonTalk would give a warning when a
    robot pressed spaced to a picture since its meaning was changed from &quot;next
    image&quot; to &quot;turn on&quot;. This warning (and accompanying offer to automatically
    update things) no longer applies to robots created in a version of ToonTalk made after
    today.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 10/31/00 that could cause
    errors when loading non-BMP picture files.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way Java applets copy things. Among other things
    connections between birds and nests are preserved correctly now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a Java applet was generated with erased pictures
    that were zero-sized.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems in Java applets using the remote control for
    the looks of a text pad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets no longer break if a non-text object is dropped
    on an erased text pad.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the puzzle game, Marty gives you a new hint if you walk
    over to him and he's not talking (and you've left the room at least once since he
    introduced the current puzzle). The check for whether he was talking didn't work right if
    he was using subtitles rather than a talk balloon and so he would sometimes skip over some
    hints.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes caused an internal error while
    quitting the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes occurred when a robot vacuumed
    up a notebook.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when long-distance birds were involved the log file
    contained a spurious warning about a nest having a negative number of birds associated
    with it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird (and not her nest) is in a box in a thought bubble
    of a robot and that robot was saved the bird was turned into a long-distance bird. Note
    that you can still put a long-distance bird in a robot's thought bubble by saving the bird
    first and then putting it in the thought bubble box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare bug in Java applets dealing with a robot
    dropping something on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if rubout is typed too many times while
    changing the label of a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes you could change a notebook
    of remote controls for a picture and the change effected all such notebooks of that user.
    (Might be this could also happen to other built-in notebooks before this fix.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is destroyed (e.g. dropped in a notebook) while
    its notebook of remote controls is on the floor, the notebook now disappears instantly. It
    used to be it would be destroyed several seconds later and if used in the interim errors
    could occur.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots that flip over pictures now run faster when not being
    watched.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Birds and sensors in a thought bubble shouldn't really keep
    links to nests and pictures, respectively. When a robot is saved such links are no longer
    kept.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something in a thought bubble formed a cycle of references
    (e.g. the remote control for the looks of a picture on the back of the picture) then it
    sometimes caused problems reloading.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a flipped picture was displayed without displaying
    things on the back (until you flipped it twice). Fixed now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with very small things that are on the back
    of pictures that caused its geometry to have visible round off errors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where occasionally when flipping (by hand not
    by robot) a picture over the notebook of remote controls didn't appear.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where difficulties describing the contents of
    a thought bubble sometimes lead to an error. One such difficulty was if the description of
    the contents of the thought bubble were too long (i.e. over 10K).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved how Java applets work when a built-in notebook is
    copied.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in Java applets with flipping over the parts
    sensor of a picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when starting to run a demo ToonTalk asked the user
    for his or her name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the command line options -i, -I, or -city are used then
    the local ini file associated with the file name argument is used if it exists.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The local ini file is now also consulted when launching
    ToonTalk (from StartTT). This means for example that a DMO file can have an associated INI
    file that sets the DemoToonTalk32 entry to the desired version of the ToonTalk executable.
    A DMO or CTY file can even reset the other Directory entries so that a different
    installation of ToonTalk is used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with local INI files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added the new command line options
    &quot;-create_narration&quot; and &quot;-print_narration_start_times&quot;. These are
    useful for <a href="make_dmo.htm">creating your own demos</a> with narration.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now create a narration file of a demo while replaying
    the demo without creating a new one. (It used to be you need to use both -I and -o to add
    narration to an existing demo.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk generates a narration file, it now only
    includes those WAV files that are needed. Previously it included all the appropriately
    named WAV files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added the new toontalk.ini (and local ini file) option in the
    Switches section. If &quot;ExitWhenDemoEnds=0&quot; then when a demo ends, the user is
    left in control rather than exiting ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when searching for a URL that doesn't exist,
    ToonTalk mistakenly believed it did exist.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk can't load a non-BMP picture file (e.g. JPG, PNG,
    or GIF) either because the file is missing (or not reachable if an Internet URL) or
    because the version of ToonTalk doesn't have the DirectX Media installed, then ToonTalk
    will attempt to load a BMP file with the same name (except for the extension) instead.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that interfered with finding the needed GIF
    or AU files for a Java applet on the FileSearchPath.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk pictures containing JPG pictures can now be
    translated to Java applets without requiring the GIF equivalent of the files.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer imposes a limit of 128 objects on the
    screen at once. The only limits now are memory and the time it takes to display the scene.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally something sitting on top of a notebook would
    display as if it were on top of the notebook but under the top pages of the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where after generating a Java applet that
    contains user-defined sounds that those sounds caused errors if used afterwards.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets that use sensors displaying text now work in
    Portuguese and Swedish (previously some worked in Swedish) in addition to English.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error message for missing picture files to only
    append &quot;.bmp&quot; when appropriate.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced 2 days earlier that broke non-BMP
    pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when a truck was loaded by a robot on the
    back of a picture (and no address was given).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading long-distance birds introduced a week
    ago.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In some screen resolutions when the programmer has a hat or
    long hair, a part of the hat or hair was displayed behind the head.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robot was trained to drop something back on
    the stack it came from, the corresponding Java applet didn't work right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping some things back on its stack (e.g. in Tooly or a
    notebook) only worked correctly for certain type of things (broken since 1/16/01).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some recently introduced problems generating Java
    applets for user-defined pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when something was moved by a robot, an image of
    where it was remained for a short while.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">13/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In a Java applet a notebook no longer matches a copy of
    itself unless it has been erased.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes Marty would wait several
    seconds to give help when called via F1.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error handling if ToonTalk is run at a screen
    resolution of 320x240 but the corresponding graphics data file is missing. (A common
    problem when installing the beta version over the trial version.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flipped a text or number pad over twice and then
    erased it, it became an erased picture instead of an erased pad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you type '.', ' ', '-', or '+' to a scale it now behaves
    sensibly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty would sometimes repeatedly give
    the same description of an erased picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now put a scale on the back of a picture. (Though I'm
    not sure that this is useful but it is consistent.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;touching who?&quot; sensor no longer shows a
    flipped over picture or text pad.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">14/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">An error sometimes occurred when a robot picked up a box from
    a nest and typed a number to change the number of holes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the labels on a box were displayed beyond the edge
    of the box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating a Java applet when a picture has
    an erased picture on top (not very useful).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a named Java applet is being generated and a
    previous attempt was aborted or had an error, the new applet wasn't processed correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something was running when converted to a Java applet
    sometimes some of the robots were not converted and the applet didn't run properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem the occurred sometimes when a Java applet
    copies sensors on the back of pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">15/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When generating a text-based Java applet, ToonTalk now uses
    the label on a bird to label the results and the label of a nest without a bird as a
    prompt to the user to enter data. Previously these were ignored and only the box labels
    under these objects were used if there were any.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Labels of birds and nests can now be one more than one line
    and still work in Java applets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes flipped pictures in a box on the back of a picture
    got the &quot;allegiance&quot; of its sensors incorrectly transferred to the containing
    picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now, like ToonTalk, now have two behaviors for
    trucks that are loaded on the back of a picture. If no address is given the team runs on
    the back of the picture. Otherwise it runs in a new house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something was dropped on the remote control for the looks
    of something then Bammer the Mouse sometimes used his hammer on a point mid-way between
    the sensor and the object being controlled.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that occasionally caused an error when a
    notebook was being destroyed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Digits on number pads are now displayed with a narrower font
    when ToonTalk is run with double-byte characters (e.g. Japanese).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that occurred sometimes in Java applets when
    pictures with sensors on the back were in a box which was joined to another box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in Java applets if invalid keystrokes are
    sent a number (e.g. 's').</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way Java applets copy robots.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">16/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you run demos by clicking on the 'See Demos' button,
    ToonTalk now checks whether they have local ini files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now produces correct Java for a robot that vacuums
    up his box.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">17/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem that interfered with a
    bird and her nest being on the back of different pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some kinds of failure to produce a working Java applet now
    cause a dialog box to appear offering to give trouble-shooting help.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The position of text and numbers on top of pictures in Java
    applets is now closer to the original layout in ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes occurred when a robot in
    another house sucked up his box.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">18/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text-based Java applets now run several times faster since
    they no longer sleep to maintain a good frame rate. (Problem was introduced on 11/22/00.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The user log file now contains a list of media files that a
    generated Java applet needs to run properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the Network entry <a
    href="ttini.htm#SaveNestsAndBirdsAsLocal">SaveNestsAndBirdsAsLocal</a> is set to 1 in
    toontalk.ini</font>,<font face="Comic Sans MS"> birds can once again be saved without
    their nests so that when reconstructed the birds will build a new nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets involving trucks in
    notebooks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets when the same robot
    is on multiple pages of a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets with notebooks in
    trucks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that occasionally caused an error when a
    robot who is not the first member of his team sets off a bomb.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many exceptions in a Java applet now only stop the team, not
    the whole applet when they occur. E.g. when a number becomes too big, or division by zero.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that prevented Marty from giving a hint in
    the puzzle game about using the bomb to start over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated the Examples notebook on page 6.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="Beta 27">Beta 26 released</a>.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">19/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes an error was triggered when describing (either by
    Marty or as a comment in a Java applet) a read-only sensor that has had a number dropped
    on it (e.g. the random number sensor). Also do more error checking for problems describing
    things now so the consequences of the problem are minimized.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while training a robot a key is typed to a number that is
    invalid (e.g. any of the letters in &quot;invalid&quot;), then the robot doesn't remember
    it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk froze when you were holding (directly or
    via the magic wand) a picture with active collision sensors. Problem introduced on 9/9/00.
    Thanks to Jerry Balzano for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The new Examples notebook introduced on 18/2 won't load in
    old demos. Fixed by introducing a new version of the string DLL. Again thanks to Jerry
    Balzano for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 26b released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">20/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes an Internet file was cached but ToonTalk didn't use
    it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem turning an Internet URL into a text pad of
    its contents.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The 'File to Picture' sensor has been extended to deal with
    files of text that are not pictures. Dropping a file name (including an Internet URL) on
    the sensor will now result in a text pad of the contents of that file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is defined by a file that no longer exists then
    sometimes ToonTalk made an extra wasteful attempt to read the file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a serious memory leak dealing with non-BMP pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk fails to find an HTML file to display it now
    looks for the file in the directory given in the toontalk.ini file at the value of
    HTMLFiles in the Directory. And if none is given it uses the appropriate directory at <a
    href="http://www.toontalk.com">www.toontalk.com</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now accepts JPEG files with the extension JPEG (as
    well JPG which it has for some time now).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the File to Picture sensor which sometimes
    caused errors later.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">21/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various bugs in the File to Picture sensor introduced
    the day before.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text pads are currently limited to a maximum length of 64K
    (65,536). ToonTalk now handles better importing text files that are larger than that.
    Though they are truncated to 64K.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a multi-line text pad is dropped on an erased box, the
    new line characters are now replaced by the language-specific name for the 'Enter' key.
    (&quot;Enter&quot; in English.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of multi-line text.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of box labels when the space is small
    and the label doesn't fit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the Java applet would continue to run (and just
    waste CPU cycles) after all the robots were finished.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a truck contains a box with a nest with an egg in it (e.g.
    pasted in that way) and it is dropped then the egg hatched but the bird was hard to find.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a small nest with an egg in it is dropped the bird now
    grows to a normal size quickly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk didn't always deal correctly with local files that
    are given in the URL format, e.g. file:///c:/toontalk/readme.txt.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to type '+' or '-' to the remote
    control for the looks of a picture in order to change its appearance or color, he did
    nothing when translated to Java.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">9 of the built-in sounds did not play back in a Java applet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of the images of flowers did not have GIF equivalents
    for Java applets.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">24/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Java class archive or media files are needed and haven't
    been installed ToonTalk will now search for them on the CD-ROM and the FileSearchPath and
    if found copy them to the Java subdirectory of ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">26/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you saved a city while holding
    Dusty, Pumpy, or the Magic Wand then when you reloaded the city you found an extra copy of
    what you are holding on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally when Marty is speaking and using subtitles that
    some subtitles weren't shown.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the remote control for the looks of a text pad was erased
    and then something dropped on top, it couldn't be erased again. Thanks to Ross for
    providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to drop something on the side of
    something (e.g. the right side of a text pad) and then is run where something that doesn't
    care which side (e.g. a number pad) is underneath, then the robot now succeeds in dropping
    what he is holding on top. Fixed for Java applets as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 2/19/01 that sometimes caused
    descriptions of robots to be truncated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in Java applets that involve ToonTalk
    animations from the Pictures notebook, that caused them not to display until something
    else changes in the applet.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">27/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some erased sensors in a thought bubble (&quot;touching
    who&quot;, &quot;file to picture&quot;, and &quot;file to sound&quot;) didn't translate to
    Java correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">File to Picture and File to Sound now work in Java applets
    (if the appropriate GIF or JPG or JPEG or AU file is available).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text pads that have been flipped and erased didn't translate
    to Java correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Multi-lined text pads had too narrow a font width when the
    last line was the longest one.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with handling the 'backspace' key in Java
    applets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem typing to pictures of text pads in Java
    applets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying zero-long text pads in Java
    applets.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">28/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem destroying a nest with things on top
    (e.g. the nest is in a box that was vacuumed by a robot or it was dropped on a notebook).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where foreign birds
    didn't animate the delivery of things and they dropped them in the corner of the screen
    rather than on the nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk tries to load a DLL for a foreign bird, it now
    asks permission in all cases except when the programmer (as opposed to a robot) caused the
    DLL to be loaded. Permission is a good idea since DLLs can do anything. If
    AskBeforeForeignBirdsLoadDLL=0 in the Switches section of toontalk.ini then permission is
    granted to all installed DLLs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer uses the FileSearchPath to find DLLs for
    foreign birds. They must be installed in the ToonTalk directory. This is because otherwise
    it could be a major security leak (i.e. a way to implement viruses in ToonTalk).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a DLL implementing a foreign bird neglects to set some
    output values, ToonTalk no longer triggers an error.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where an error occurred while trying to make
    an abnormal termination (typically due to fatal DirectX errors) that caused dialog boxes
    to repeatedly show up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the help messages generated by the 'File' foreign
    bird extension.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a notebook is loaded and the file or encoding has been
    truncated, the first part of the notebook now loads fine.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes caused DirectX errors when
    warnings were displayed before ToonTalk had finished initializing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem where after being interrupted ToonTalk
    has the wrong color palette.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced a few days ago that caused errors
    while quitting ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced in November 1999 that caused
    foreign birds to animate in a confusing manner.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Primitive birds that were not able to load their associated
    DLLs now behave just like ordinary birds - including how Marty gives help for using them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Errors followed if you tried to train a robot to vacuum
    something from the main notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you or a robot you were training vacuum up a page from one
    of the notebooks that live in the main notebook (Pictures, Sounds, Examples, Sensors, or
    Options) then those changes were permanent for that user name. Thanks to Micke for
    reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture was flipped over and you flipped a remote
    control for its look back over then the notebook of sensors fly under the picture. This
    now happens only if the front side of the picture is showing. Thanks to Micke for
    reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many of the options in the Directories section of
    toontalk.ini now support the use of '*' to mean the users subdirectory of the ToonTalk's
    User directory. So for example, &quot;URLCacheDir=*\..\..\Downloads&quot; sets the cache
    directory for URLs to a subdirectory of ToonTalk called &quot;Downloads&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk needs a file that is only on the ToonTalk CD-ROM,
    it asks the user to insert the CD. It now does so a maximum of 3 times.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk is looking for a file on the ToonTalk CD-ROM,
    it now can deal with either version 1 or version 2 CD-ROMs. Thanks to Ross for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you try to run ToonTalk at a screen resolution that your
    computer can't handle then you get a dialog box saying that the default resolution is
    changed and to try again. The default resolution was changed for only new users - now it
    is changed for all users.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way ToonTalk shuts down.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk.ini entries did not work correctly if they were
    longer than 255 characters. There is no limit to their size now. Thanks to Ross for
    reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now loads the local ini file of a city regardless of
    how the city was loaded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now saves the local ini file of a city when it is
    saved if the local ini file came from the loading of a city (as opposed to loading a TT
    file).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the handling of the INI entry
    URLCacheDir.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when flipping the view of a picture's parts sensor
    the appearance wasn't updated. Thanks to Micke for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pumpy wasn't able to expand pixel size objects on fast
    computers. Thanks to Micke for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now loads a local ini file of a TT file when the
    file is loaded. Earlier this only worked if the TT file was loaded while ToonTalk was
    starting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the URLCacheDir has an entry then it is also added to the
    FileSearchPath.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if a local INI file was loaded prior to
    finding out the name of the user.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when a robot flips a text pad over and then
    uses it again later. Thanks to Micke for providing an example where this happened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made the processing of path names from INI entries more
    robust so they aren't broken by preceding and trailing spaces. And &quot;\..&quot; in a
    path is now simplified.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the installation program so that city (CTY), ToonTalk
    object (TT), demo (DMO), user profile (USR) and puzzle (PZL) files are registered as MIME
    types.&nbsp; In theory this means that programs other than the Windows Explorer and
    Internet Explorer will do the right thing if you click on one of these files. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem that caused the user's
    log file to contain warnings about something becoming a part of something while still on
    the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes sensors weren't updated when robots used them on
    the back of a picture. Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A picture of a text or number pad can now receive a new
    appearance after being erased. Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When running ToonTalk with speech and no talk balloons Marty
    would sometimes skip over hints in the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced yesterday with sensors like 'File
    to Picture' that become black when their current value is sucked off. Thanks to Ross for
    reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced a week ago that prevented you from
    changing the main notebook. Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in the generation of descriptions of unnamed
    robots. (Introduced a few weeks ago.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you try to train a robot to vacuum
    something off the main notebook (or you or a robot tries to vacuum a page from a picture's
    notebook of sensors) then the page could be removed by hand. Thanks to Ross for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="Beta 28">Released Beta 27b</a> (beta 27 was
    aborted).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty appeared with no talk balloon in the credits screen if
    he was set to use subtitles or only to speak.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">14/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a sensor is on a nest then it doesn't change who it is
    sensing when placed on the back of a picture. This wasn't true if you saved and then
    restored such a picture. Thanks to Dreyfuss Pierre-Andre for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an error occurs while describing something (e.g. the
    preamble to the encoding when something is put on the clipboard) then it now only
    interferes with the generation of the description and doesn't signal an error.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Generating the description of a robot while he is working
    sometimes caused an error. Thanks to Micke Kindborg for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A spurious warning was sometimes generated when dropping a
    number on certain sensors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some sensors (e.g. &quot;Visible?&quot;) were not kept
    up-to-date if more than one copy of the sensor existed. Thanks to Dreyfuss Pierre-Andre
    for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer crashes if you drop a picture on the back
    of the remote control for its looks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk sometimes crashed if you dropped a user-defined
    sound pad on another user-defined sound pad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a sound was imported into ToonTalk from a directory that
    wasn't on the FileSearchPath then copies of the sound couldn't find the WAV file.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">15/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when flying the helicopter over the eastern edge of
    your city the easternmost street was draw with water showing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Under some unusual circumstances Marty wouldn't talk in the
    puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would only say one sentence and stop if certain voice
    engines were chosen (this was only observed with Truvoice engines).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now select and copy a part of a stack of pictures
    with the magic wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now uses a more robust method to decide if the
    text-to-speech engine can only say some words (and spells the rest).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of problems that might occur while
    initializing the text-to-speech system.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">16/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in using the keyboard to change some sensors
    introduced 2 days earlier.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sensors whose value are multi-line text pads no longer show
    an animated background since the text pad marquee is already animated indicating that it
    is a sensor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you visit a city that was saved
    while on the floor, the main notebook showed the wrong user name. Thanks to Ross for
    tracking this down.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensor for turning on and off sound effects wasn't
    working correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you made changes for all users using 'Set Options' these
    changes took effect even if overridden using the 'Options' notebook in your main notebook
    for several hours. (The number of hours depended upon your time zone relative to GMT.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the DefaultUser toontalk.ini feature
    that caused part of the default information to sometimes be ignored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk will no longer load the string DLL from the
    connected directory but will always get it from the ToonTalk directory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you run ToonTalk in full-screen mode at a resolution your
    computer doesn't support then ToonTalk provides a message that the default resolution has
    been changed and you should try again. Prior to this fix its change of resolution only
    worked for new users.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A new entry 'LeftAndRightMouseButtonsDownMeansEscape' was
    added to toontalk.ini so that you must set this entry to 1 to retain the feature that
    clicking the left and right mouse button is interpreted as pressing the Escape key.
    Previously this was enabled only if mouse shortcuts were enabled.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk was started in a window and it needs to load
    URLs or search for them, then the window was started with the wrong colors (pausing and
    resuming always fixed it). Fixed now.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">17/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a ToonTalk executable is run directly (not via StartTT or
    double clicking a ToonTalk file), then ToonTalk now offers to make this executable the
    default.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a demo is run with a different executable than it was
    created with a warning is added to the log file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the animated background of a sensor would stop
    animating for a while.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">18/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem using the built-in voice for ToonTalk when
    installing from a CD-ROM with a &quot;minimal install&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">19/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When using Pumpy on a picture sometimes the white box that is
    displayed to emphasize the selection is left on the screen for a second or two after the
    picture has shrunk to a smaller size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the <a
    href="command.htm#FrameDurationMinimum">minimum frame duration</a> has been inoperative
    since January 2000.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a major memory leak that depended upon the screen
    resolution, amount of physical memory, and usage pattern - on machines with 256 Mbytes
    rarely if ever occurred. Problem was introduced in May 2000.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">21/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you typed '-' to a sensor showing 'no' then it went black.
    Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets that frequently copied remote controls ran
    slowly and used lots of memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now often can recover from an error that there is no
    enough memory while creating a DirectDraw surface.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="Beta 29">Released Beta 28</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that occurs only on very fast machines when very
    little is happening and no memory is devoted to caching (i.e. '-m 0' on the command line).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">26/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that put a warning in the user's log file
    about something becoming part of something while still on the floor. (I think this only
    occurred sometimes during the puzzle game if a robot was running when you brought Marty a
    solution.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk runs out of memory it shrinks the cache it is
    using. This code correctly freed up memory but it neglected to set a lower subsequent cap
    on cache memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The random number remote control in some situations produced
    numbers from 0 to 1000 rather than 0 to 999.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you set of a bomb on puzzle 48 after loading a truck then
    you ended up with an extra house and the following puzzle wasn't solvable. Thanks to Manal
    El Khoreiby for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">27/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you give a long-distance bird something that has robots
    running on the back then the robots will be running when the bird arrives at its nest.
    Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">29/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some circumstances where Marty has something to say but
    doesn't say it. Probably only happened in the puzzle game running with subtitles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk had troubles producing a Java applet for pictures
    with huge amounts of things on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you the ran ToonTalk puzzle game with the '-n' command
    line option to specify your name, then the saved state when you last quit the puzzle game
    wasn't always restored properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed an installation problem that gave a useless default
    meaning to the 5th joystick button.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems with Java applets of robots that get rid
    of their box (e.g. putting it in a truck).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with Java applets of robots that copy the top
    element on top of a nest with the magic wand.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">30/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where adding numbers to the current address
    turned then black.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets when one of the
    built-in notebooks was placed in a truck or box before generating the applet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes dropping something on a picture turned off its
    collision sensors for a cycle. Thanks to Ross for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot on the back of a picture stopped while holding
    something and the picture was flipped over then what he was holding appeared on the floor
    but couldn't be picked up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A Java applet containing ToonTalk animation (e.g. person
    walking) had the wrong size for the pictures if running at a resolution greater than
    640x480.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way a robot uses a vacuum on the back of a
    picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes in a Java applet when a picture has been erased and
    a new picture dropped on top both images were displayed. Thanks to Ross for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensors that showing whether something is colliding can
    be changed with the keyboard to undo a collision. This wasn't working right in Java
    applets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensor showing whether something was dropped doesn't
    really make sense in Java. It now always shows 'yes' rather than 'no'. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensor showing whether your hand is visible in Java now
    always shows 'no' rather than 'yes'.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now deals much better with very large pictures
    created while on the ground. (On the floor you can't make something bigger than the entire
    floor.) It used to use up memory and sometimes crashed if you made a picture 100 times
    bigger than usual. Such very large pictures sometimes still seem to disappear.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dialog box added on 17/3/01 when running a different
    executable than expected would sometimes be buried under other windows. Fixed now.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem running demos that involved long-distance
    birds. (Though in general the demos don't currently recreate incoming messages so such
    demos will probably fail.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you installed ToonTalk on a computer with more than 7
    text-to-speech voices previously installed then the default voice (USMarty2 for the US
    version) was not the default when running 'Set Options' but the first voice found was.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug processing FileSearchPath when * was used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Version 2.36 released.</font></li>
  <li><a name="Beta 30"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 29 released.</font></a></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if Marty was speaking and subtitles were
    being displayed where Marty won't say the second thing he would normally say.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you used 'Set Options' to change the resolution to 320x240
    it only worked for new users. The next time they ran ToonTalk it switched to 640x480.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle file just contains the name of an HTML file,
    ToonTalk quits and launches a browser on the HTML page. In full-screen mode, a dialog box
    informing the user that ToonTalk has been paused appeared. And if ToonTalk offered another
    dialog box, e.g. that you can run with a higher screen resolution, then the puzzle's HTML
    file wasn't always displayed. Currently this feature is only used in some trial versions
    of ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If <a href="ttini.htm#URLCacheDir">URLCacheDir</a> is set
    then sometimes 0-byte files were created.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets when the pictures or
    sounds are found on the Internet due to the setting of <a href="ttini.htm#FileSearchPath">FileSearchPath</a>.
    Also eliminated some redundant work here.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that interfered with Start ToonTalk asking
    for the ToonTalk CD-ROM when running demos from a ToonTalk installed from a CD-ROM and the
    demos weren't installed on the local disk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Start ToonTalk now displays an informative dialog box if
    demos are requested that weren't installed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk is installed and there are no voices then the
    option of Marty speaking with subtitles is now disabled and commented as unavailable.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made several improvements to how ToonTalk uses the system
    file cache when dealing with URLs and <a href="ttini.htm#URLCacheDir">URLCacheDir</a>
    isn't set.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem that caused Marty to
    sometimes ignore the PageUp button to have him repeat what he last said.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed yet another problem with Marty stopping talking when
    'Set Options' is set to speech and subtitles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when maximizing full-screen ToonTalk when it has
    been iconized triggered a DirectDraw error.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot that already has a tool (e.g. many of
    the puzzles an untrained robot has a magic wand) and you finish training him with him
    holding the tool and there are things left behind that the robot when run vacuums up then
    the robot got mixed up and stopped after finishing one cycle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Removed a limitation of the file names of BMP files of a
    maximum length of 128 characters. This interfered with using the system file cache since
    such long names are common.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you pressed PageUp and Marty was away, he would teleport
    in and then repeat the last thing he said. This interferes with user program that want to
    use PageUp and so he only repeats himself on PageUp if he is already on screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of imported sounds and their subsequent
    export (e.g. in a city). If the sound can't be found on the original path but can be found
    on the FileSearchPath (or the Users subdirectory) then the sound name changes from the
    full path to the short name. Also it can deal with URLs that are cached in the system file
    cache without the WAV extension.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many parts of ToonTalk were confused by file names that had
    no extension but had a '.' inside a directory name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem running some Java applets as Java
    applications (e.g. with jview.exe). If when generating an applet ToonTalk can't find GIF
    or JPG files but only BMP files then the result only runs as an application.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a Java applet contained sensors that can't be supported in
    Java (e.g. the joystick sensors), then the log file filled with spurious warnings.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that caused DirectX errors when a Java applet
    was being generated and ToonTalk needed to search the Internet for missing sounds or
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the latest ToonTalk (version 2.37) was installed by a
    patch file then it will look for Java built-in sounds and pictures in the directories only
    used by earlier versions of ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a WAVE file is loaded over the Internet and <a
    href="ttini.htm#URLCacheDir">URLCacheDir</a> isn't set then you got an MCI error about a
    file not being found.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If due to other bugs a sound is loaded with an empty file
    name it no longer causes further errors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If in a Java applet robots on the back of a picture in a box
    give it a speed or change its position the speed remains at zero and the position doesn't
    change. Thanks to Ross for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If in a Java applet, a &quot;touching who&quot; sensor is
    added to the back of a picture that is already colliding (and some other collision sensors
    for this picture are active) then the sensor wasn't updated until a second collision
    occurs. Thanks to Ross for providing an example of this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now handles better user sound files that have no
    data, just a header. They don't make any sounds of course.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced a new mode for Marty - &quot;subtitles without
    speech&quot;.&nbsp; Previously if subtitles were chosen and speech wasn't operational
    (e.g. no voices or no sound card) then the subtitles got stuck.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where there was sometimes a delay in updating
    numeric sensors when placed on the back of a new picture. Thanks to Ross for providing an
    example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">By pressing 'Esc' during the titles it sometimes cut the
    speed which Marty displays text if not speaking in half. E.g. talk balloons or subtitles
    stayed up twice as long as normal.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Parenthetical remarks are no longer removed from long
    subtitles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk describes the name of a file for a picture it
    now uses the short version of the name if the full path no longer contains a file and the
    picture can be found using the <a href="ttini.htm#FileSearchPath">FileSearchPath</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a sound was loaded using a URL (i.e. a non-local file)
    then the full path is maintained and not shortened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The <a href="ttini.htm#SpokenLanguage">SpokenLanguage</a>
    option is now ignored if Marty is not in a mode where he speaks.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when no voices are installed on a computer, 'Set
    Options' gives a choice of a voice named and then nothing follows.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The new mode of Marty &quot;subtitles without speech&quot;
    sometimes responded correctly to PageDown to skip to the next line and sometimes not.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle sequence ended with a puzzle containing the name
    of an HTML file to display and then that same user name attempted to play the puzzle game
    again an error occurred.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If when ToonTalk starts it needs to load files from the
    Internet or a CD-ROM then the title bar of the window now informs you of the status and
    asks you wait.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">13/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle file contains just the name of an HTML file then
    it was shown as you entered the rocket rather than when you leave. Broken the day before.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have solved all the puzzles and are running ToonTalk
    in a window (not full-screen) then if you answer the dialog box that you want to start
    over again, you started again with the wrong color palette.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Version 2.39 released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">17/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 11/4 that caused sounds from WAV
    files to be silent.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated the option screen about turning sound on or off to
    make it clear that it is only for sound effects and does not turn off speech.</font></li>
  <li><a name="Beta 31"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.39b and Beta 30.</font></a></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">19/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced a new toontalk.ini called
    &quot;MaximumItemsInDusty&quot; in the &quot;Switches&quot; section which limits the
    number of objects kept inside of Dusty's stomach. Useful if you typically work in a saved
    city and then save it again since everything Dusty ever vacuumed remains in his stomach
    taking up memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem training a robot with a box containing a
    flipped remote control for a picture's look. Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the toontalk.ini entry &quot;BackgroundsDir&quot; in the
    &quot;Directories&quot; section is set then if some backgrounds are missing from that
    directory ToonTalk no longer looks for them using the FileSearchPath.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a language version of ToonTalk is only installed on the
    CD-ROM, then ToonTalk used to ask for the CD-ROM with a blank message box. It now asks in
    English (since it hasn't found the file with the language-specific text strings).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer displays yes/no message boxes with no text
    (e.g. the bug above).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">29/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated the Swedish translation of ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added a new entry in the Directories section of toontalk.ini.
    If MainNotebookLabel is set to a file name (which can include an * which is the user's
    subdirectory of the Users directory) then the ToonTalk object at the file location is used
    as a logo for the main notebook.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in the Puzzle Game in situations where in
    Free Play Marty would beam in to describe a problem. This left Marty in an unstable
    condition that could cause errors on later puzzles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes ToonTalk would have an error
    while quitting while Marty was talking. (This problem was not normally observed since it
    usually caused ToonTalk to exit prematurely while quitting.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if saving (by typing control-c) an object after
    flipping it back over, it was restored as the size it was when flipped. This problem can
    be avoided on older versions of ToonTalk by dropping and then picking the object up before
    saving it.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem recording a demo log that pasted something
    from the clipboard whose encoding was larger than 64K.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes occurred when dropping a
    remote looks of a picture on an erased picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the new option added on 1/6 (MainNotebookLabel) so
    that the user's name is displayed on top of the logo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The internal implementation that determines if two things are
    the same (e.g. dropping something back on a stack) was completely rewritten and is much
    faster.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Objects containing copies of the same thing (picture, robot,
    whatever) are now saved much more compactly. Can reduce the size of a city or encoding by
    a factor of 10. The new Switches entry in toontalk.ini DumpCopiesCompactly can be set to
    zero to turn this feature off and save things as before.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">13/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made small improvement to the way ToonTalk launches a browser
    when showing trouble shooting or other advice.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">16/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the wall decoration remote control where
    some objects were displayed on the wall in not quite the right position.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">19/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java of a sound whose file name
    contains '\' - e.g. anything other than the short name used when the file is on the
    FileSearchPath.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you log in with a new name and the DefaultUser is old then
    you get a dialog box asking if you want Marty to forget everything you've done.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">20/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If in the &quot;FileExtensions&quot; section of the
    toontalk.ini file you have &quot;MissingPictureFileExtension=gif&quot; then if a non-GIF
    file for a picture is missing then and the GIF version exists then the picture will be
    changed to use the GIF version from then on. Good for switching from one file format to
    another for an application with lots of pictures. &quot;jpg&quot;, &quot;png&quot;, and
    &quot;jpeg&quot; are other correct values.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you removed something from the remote control for the wall
    decoration then the remaining items were placed wrong (sometimes even off the edge).
    Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">21/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a flipped picture on a decoration sensor
    (room, house, or roof) it was added. No longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The new code for deciding if two things were equal considered
    two pictures equal even if they differed by &quot;SEE ALL&quot;, &quot;SEE SOME&quot;, or
    &quot;SEE NONE&quot;. This meant that if something was saved in the new compact mode and
    two kinds of visibility for the same picture occurred then when loaded they will have the
    same kind of visibility.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes occurred while running Java
    applets that used a remote control that displays a picture (e.g. touching who).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem converting to Java a robot that has a flipped
    picture in the box in his thought bubble.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">23/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size and placement of built-in
    animations (e.g. person walking) when converted to a Java applet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The new &quot;MissingPictureFileExtension&quot; didn't work
    right if a picture had been created with the BMP extension (rather than just default to
    it). Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">24/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a few small memory leaks and very large one when
    converting to Java something that contains notebooks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem converting to Java something that contained
    the built-in Examples notebook.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">25/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When copies of the same notebook, robot, or flipped picture
    appear in something being converted to a Java applet, they now share the same generated
    Java code.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the new version of testing if two things
    are equal that didn't work for some notebooks resulting in less compaction.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">26/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty behaved strangely and the credits were not given if you
    visit a city that was saved while Marty was talking.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced a new command line option &quot;-ini_file &lt;file
    name&gt;&quot; that can specify a new location for the toontalk.ini file. The default
    continues to be &quot;toontalk.ini&quot; on the Windows directory (called
    &quot;WinNT&quot; on Windows NT and 2000). This is useful for installations where access
    to the default location of the toontalk.ini file is restricted for security reasons. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">27/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the autorun executable so that the next CD-ROM to be
    capable of being run off the CD-ROM without installation (though this isn't recommended
    because voices and the latest DirectX and speech facilities won't be installed).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Command line options that specify file names or user names
    can now be quoted and contain spaces. E.g. -n &quot;Ken Kahn&quot; on the command line
    makes the user name always be Ken Kahn.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 31 released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta 32"><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/7</font></a> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you press F11 while sitting on the floor with nothing in
    your hand then Bammer will run out backwards and undo the last thing he did. (If you are
    holding something F11 means drop it and Bammer should ignore it.) This is a single-level
    undo for Bammer for each house - pressing F11 again will not undo the &quot;bam&quot;
    prior to the last one.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now press F11 after Bammer has come out while
    training a robot and the robot will remember things as if the object was dropped on the
    floor not on the original target.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 12/6 that interfered with
    generating a new demo log files.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem when something is dropped
    on something while Bammer is dealing with a different drop. Thanks to Ross for reporting
    it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem generating a Java applet
    when copies of the same picture were involved.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">13/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos that start in a city with a modified main notebook,
    only replayed if ToonTalk was installed on the same directory as when the demo was
    recorded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the geometry of copies of the same
    picture when translated to Java.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way remote control for looks in a thought bubble
    for a robot are saved (to files or the clipboard).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">16/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when Marty was speaking a different language
    than was being used to display subtitles where the last subtitles were sometimes not
    displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when something was dropped on a sensor the
    translated Java ignored it.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">17/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sensors were sometimes saved so that when loaded back they
    displayed an old value.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a negative number was dropped on certain sensors (e.g. the
    random number generator) then the translated Java version used the positive version of the
    number.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture has robot running on the back and is copied then
    the corresponding Java didn't always run the copied robots.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a picture with robots and boxes on the back is
    dropped on an erased picture the sensors in the boxes didn't work properly in the Java
    applet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a sensor's value was changed (e.g. by dropping something
    on top) then copies of that sensor were not always updated in Java applets.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something on top of a nest was copied by the Magic Wand
    then the corresponding Java applet didn't work right.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">15/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Touch sensitive mice are now supported by ToonTalk. You'll
    feel the helicopter, walls, etc. much like you do when using a force-feedback joystick.
    You'll also find a sensor notebook (at the end of the main sensor notebook) for using
    these effects in your own programs. You can have both a mouse and joystick and control and
    sense them independently. Note that the mouse uses the mforces.ifr while the joysticks use
    forces.ifr. You can edit either one using <a href="http://www.immersion.com">Immersion
    Studio</a>. Note that if you add new effects you'll need to add them to both files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that has broken the joystick button down sensors
    for buttons number 27 to 32 since April 2000. Until there is a new file format for
    ToonTalk, these button sensors will be restored as active even if were turned off before
    being saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pasting joystick buttons were active but didn't display an
    animated marquee until there values changed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the text on the opposite page of joystick and touch
    sensitive mouse notebooks.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">16/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added labels to joystick and touch sensitive mouse notebooks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced in early June that caused Marty to
    not have a talk balloon during the credits screen when playing the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot who sets off a bomb was retrained without stopping
    him (so he also sets off a bomb), then the bomb was sometimes left on the floor after the
    training.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem describing (by Marty or for the clipboard) a
    remote control for force feedback effects when no such device was connected.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error handling when a problem occurs describing
    a notebook contained in something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes occurred when retraining a
    robot that dropped things on the main notebook (and there no longer was a matching page).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that crashed ToonTalk if a robot was trained
    to use Pumpy and was grabbed while using him.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems in training a robot to use Pumpy.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When running a robot off screen who was trained to use Pumpy,
    it didn't run faster than when watched.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When running a robot off screen who was trained to use Pumpy,
    you no longer hear the sounds Pumpy makes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where putting a force feedback effect on the
    clipboard was restored as ordinary text. Did not happen if the force feedback effect was
    contained in something.</font></li>
  <li><a name="Beta 33"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 32 released.</font></a></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">27/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fix from 15/8 of joystick button sensors 27 to 32 inactivated
    until the next file format release since broke some old programs using joystick buttons.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several bugs in the recently introduced ability to undo
    the effects of Bammer.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">14/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The customization feature MaximumItemsInDusty is now disabled
    when playing the puzzle game since it can interfere with some puzzles.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">18/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes using the collision sensor to undo a collision left
    the items overlapping by a pixel or two.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes some sensors that have an animated appearance did
    not display the animation when not selected. (Problem introduced on 17/3.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the ability to run ToonTalk directly off a CD-ROM
    with no installation.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">20/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Selection feedback is now enhanced to include color changes.
    This feature can be turned off by setting &quot;ColorSelectionFeedback&quot; to 0 in the
    Switches section of toontalk.ini.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The standard wiggling selection feedback can be turned off by
    setting &quot;MovementSelectionFeedback&quot; to 0 in the Switches section of
    toontalk.ini.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">21/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a small memory leak when quitting ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made the selection from Dusty and Pumpy completely stable.
    (For example, if you don't move the mouse then the selection doesn't change.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">25/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The toontalk.ini customization &quot;MainNotebookLabel&quot;
    did not work correctly in demos.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">24/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes prevented a gentle recovery
    from no free memory errors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The toontalk.ini switch DumpCopiesCompactly was ignored in
    demo logs.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when dropping the remote control for the
    visibility of a picture on the back of another picture. It didn't get updated properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem (introduced March 5) when Directories
    switches are set in toontalk.ini and contain spaces.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">28/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem running demos on machines without a sound
    card (or without Direct Sound drivers).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">29/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several bugs related to dropping nests on nests. (If
    nest A is dropped on nest B then all messages that would have been placed on nest A are
    placed on B instead.) Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem returning a fresh robot or a truck back into
    the stacks in Tooly the Toolbox. Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a text pad (fixed width) was saved on the clipboard (not
    because it was part of something being saved) then when pasted back it became a variable
    width text object.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Saving numbers on the clipboard (not because they are part of
    something being saved) with operations (like '*' or '/') became text pads when pasted.
    Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving a robot when something in its thought
    bubble is equal to something else being saved at the same time.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem caching media files that were obtained from a
    URL.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle 42 accepted any nest with 5 or more numbers on it. Now
    the numbers must be different. (Otherwise can get stuck on the next puzzle.) Thanks to
    Volker and his son for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When generating a Java applet using built-in sounds and
    pictures and the needed files are missing then it used to give up. Now it gives up on
    pictures if the picture files are missing and on sounds if the sound files are missing.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/12 (these changes were made during the previous 2 months)</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk can now run in 15-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit
    video modes in addition to the 8-bit (256 color) mode previously supported.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk will run in the color depth that Windows is set to
    unless you are running full-screen and have set DesiredFullScreenBitsPerPixel in the
    Switches section of toontalk.ini to a different value.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now finds its built-in imagery in the directory
    specified by BuiltinPictureDir in the Directories section of toontalk.ini. The default
    file extension is specified by MissingBuiltinPictureFileExtension in the FileExtensions
    section of toontalk.ini. The default is now to use 8-bit GIF files so they can be shared
    with the Java applet generator. 24-bit imagery such as PNG files work fine (but are not
    recommended when running with an 8-bit video mode).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Picture files now include a new extension &quot;ini&quot;.
    Currently there is only a Files section in the ini file. It can contain Picture and
    PictureMask entries. These are file names (either fully qualified or relative to the
    location of the ini file). The PictureMask file should contain white pixels for the parts
    of the Picture file that should be displayed and black for the parts that should be
    transparent. For example, [Files]<br>
    Picture=AL01.jpg<br>
    PictureMask=masks\AL01.png</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now uses a new Microsoft API (GDI+) to read picture
    files. It deals better with PNG, GIF, and JPG than the old API. It also deals better with
    transparent pixels in GIF or PNG files. It also supports Exif and TIFF files. This new
    functionality does not work in Windows 95, however.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">24-bit picture files now look much better in 8-bit video mode
    (but is a bit slow).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When an object is turned off it now looks darker. And when
    the power is turned off (via F8) then everything looks darker in a better way than
    previously.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="Beta34">Beta 33 released</a>.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">14/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem running with 16 or 24 bit graphics. Its
    affect should be limited to the appearance of the programmer persona's hair or hat.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a built-in ToonTalk picture or sound file is missing then
    on some systems (e.g. Windows 98) a dialog box appeared (even in full-screen mode but then
    it was &quot;underneath&quot; and couldn't be seen).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">17/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the way text and number pads are displayed. The new
    format looks nicer (no separators between characters) and faster. The display format of
    variable width font is now much more like the fixed width font version.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">19/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A demo file that used the millisecond timer didn't work right
    if there were any cycles that took more than 1000 milliseconds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way demos are recorded that start with a saved
    city. It should be both faster and fixes some rare cases where the demo stopped running
    properly.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">21/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Japanese version of ToonTalk now has ordinary looking
    text pads. (Prior to this the style of text pads with variable width font was the only
    available style and it didn't have a border or background color).</font></li>
</ol>
