<p align="center"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Where does turtle 
geometry fit into the picture? </font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">An instance of the 
choice between message passing and user interfaces?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Despite my love of
<a href="http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/logo/">turtle 
geometry</a> and <a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/index.html">Logo</a>,
I never added it to ToonTalk. Ten years ago I began to add it and 
also began user testing. The idea was that there was a <a href="bird.htm">bird</a> 
for each turtle. If you gave the bird a box containing the text pad &quot;FORWARD&quot; 
and the number pad &quot;100&quot; then the bird would fly to the object and it would move 
forward 100 units in the direction of its current heading. Non-programming 
adults and a fourth-grade class seemed to really get the idea of ToonTalk 
(despite its primitive state) but were unhappy with the message passing 
interface. It was too indirect and clumsy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I redesigned ToonTalk to support
<a href="remote.htm">remote controls</a> to support picture programming in a 
more direct intuitive manner. For example, a sensor for the horizontal position 
of a picture appears just as numbers do (except it has an animated marquee to 
indicate its special status). One can manipulate this remote control as an 
ordinary number and the associated picture's position changes accordingly. These 
work in both directions so if the picture is moved the number is updated. This 
scheme is similar to the property sheets used in a huge variety of software 
where the properties show the current state of an object and can be edited to 
change the object. In ToonTalk the equivalent of a property sheet is broken up 
into small pieces corresponding to single properties. This provides a nice 
&quot;declarative&quot; interface for objects. Children as young as six in the
<a href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/playground">Playground Project</a> made heavy use 
of these ToonTalk remote controls. But these remote controls only support a 
Cartesian geometry and don't support turtle geometry as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">So why not add <i>FORWARD</i> and <i>RIGHT</i> 
sensors to ToonTalk? The equivalent of a <i>RIGHT</i> sensor would be 
straightforward; just add a sensor for the heading of a picture. The equivalent 
of &quot;RIGHT 90&quot; would be to drop a number pad with &quot;90&quot; on the heading sensor and 
the current heading will be incremented by 90 degrees. But what sensor would 
play the role of FORWARD? This stumped me for many years. The best idea I have 
is to introduce a sensor for the picture's distance to where you want it to be 
(in the direction of its current heading). So if you dropped 100 on such a 
sensor the picture would move forward correctly. The really odd thing is that 
this sensor would always display &quot;0&quot; since as soon as it is changed the picture 
moves and it is where you instructed it to be. Maybe a better version would be a 
sensor for the distance to its &quot;goal&quot;. If its speed is infinite then it will 
also always display &quot;0&quot; but if it is given a finite speed it will glide towards 
it goal and the value displayed will decrement at the speed until it reaches 
zero. Some other design issues remain such as how to integrate the trails left 
by turtles' pens. Are they new objects or are they alterations of the object 
they are drawing onto?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I now believe that rather than choosing between 
message passing and user interfaces (property sheets/remote controls) that they 
should exist at different levels. The primitive low-level way of manipulating 
pictures is via message passing as I originally intended ten years ago. This 
will probably be used only by more advanced users, particularly those enhancing 
the system itself. The ideal system should provide primitive support so that 
remote controls can be built within the language. They would behave much as they 
currently do in ToonTalk but their implementation would be transparent. Ordinary 
users could inspect, edit, and create new kinds. The challenge here isn't just 
to implement sensors within the language but do so in a manner that non-experts 
can understand.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">More generally I think a good way to proceed is to 
open the development of new &quot;primitives&quot; to a wide community. The kernel of the 
system can be small but include a way to &quot;plug in&quot; modules written in any nearly 
programming language. This could be based upon an improved version of ToonTalk's
<a href="extend.htm">foreign birds</a>. This provides a way to user birds to 
interface any external code. The bird or message passing level of interface can 
then be used to provide higher level functionality in need be.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">
More recently I've revisited this issue in the context of <a href='https://github.com/ToonTalk/ToonTalk/wiki'>ToonTalk Reborn</a>.
Building upon browser primitives a <a href='http://toontalk.github.io/ToonTalk/docs/manual/examples.html'>message passing turtle</a> can be defined.
More work needs to be done to simplify its interface and add the ability to leave trails when the pen is down.
