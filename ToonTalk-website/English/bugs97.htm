<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/7/97</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed spelling of twelfth. (Thanks to Jay Schmoll and Kelly
    Johnson for pointing this out.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed spelling of CAPITAL in a puzzle. (Thanks to Jay Schmoll
    and Kelly Johnson for pointing this out.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Numbers with commas (or in other languages periods) are no
    longer broken between lines with Marty is talking. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes Marty broken sentences between talk balloons
    unnecessarily. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">While doing puzzles if you haven't used a bomb then Marty now
    suggests it much earlier than he used to. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while doing puzzles you asked Marty to repeat himself and
    then left before he finished he no longer tries to finish when you come back. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">While doing puzzles sometimes if you left while Marty was
    talking even if he didn't have more to say he tried to repeat himself when you came back. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/8 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can no longer resize the Start ToonTalk application. (Thanks
    to Jay Schmoll for suggesting this.) </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/9 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">While running ToonTalk in full screen mode if you type a
    Window's command like Alt-Tab or Ctrl-Esc confusion used to result. ToonTalk is now paused
    and minimized in this situation. (Thanks to Jay Schmoll and Kelly Johnson for pointing
    this out.) </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/14 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with newly introduced sound data type. They
    can now be placed in boxes and appropriate help is given by Marty. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/15 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Adjusted the size of buttons in the Start ToonTalk program to
    accommodate languages that need more space. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that caused the system to crash when Marty was
    talking about a robot that uses the new built in sound type. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in puzzle mode which sometimes caused a crash
    when leaving the house. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/16 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle required robots trained in the previous puzzle
    then if you quit and started again then the robots previously trained were lost. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the geometry of pictures of the goal for a few puzzles.
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Titles no longer trigger the teleport in sound. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/17 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes copying a nest with things on it led to
    unpredictable behavior. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you erased something (made it blank) with Dusty and then
    put it on the back of a picture or in another house and then put Dusty in reverse it would
    be restored. Now Dusty only restores blank things that are on the screen. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/19 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk's speed is changed it no longer affects the speed
    that Marty talks or that subtitles are shown. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Redid part 2 and 3 of the Ping Pong demo and the factorial
    demo. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/20 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recent problem with training robots on boxes that
    contain covered nests. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems in how Marty gives help in using bombs. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/23 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty can talk!!!! (But only in the 32 bit version and
    currently I'm using a speech engine that I don't have the right to redistribute.) -speak 1
    will turn it on -balloon 0 will turn off talk balloons </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Scales can now be changed by typing ' ', '+', or '-' if they
    are tottering or have blanks on both sides of them. (Thanks to Leo Burd for noticing that
    this feature was broken.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">F1 quickly following F1 was ignored works now. (Thanks to Jay
    Kahn for reporting this.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If running with text-to-speech you can shift-click a text pad
    and it'll be spoken. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now have subtitles to demos spoken. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/26 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some puzzles (like #6) depend upon the previous puzzle. If
    you set off the bomb in such a puzzle you were left with an empty floor. All you could do
    is restart ToonTalk and the puzzle would be restored properly. Fixed now. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copy Dusty the vacuum you now also copy what's in his
    stomach. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a nest is copied or saved and it has 100s of things on top
    then the system crashed. This happened frequently solving puzzle p42.pzl. (Thanks to Phil
    Mercurio for reporting this.) </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If -language &lt;name&gt; is missing or misspelled then
    Versions entry for &quot;Language&quot; in toontalk.ini is used. If that is missing then
    American English is chosen. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a DLL is missing for a language the system now tries to
    get it off the CDROM if possible. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If -language &lt;name&gt; is missing or misspelled then
    Versions entry for &quot;Language&quot; in toontalk.ini is used. If that is missing then
    American English is chosen. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a DLL is missing for a language the system now tries to
    get it off the CDROM if possible. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/30 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various installation problems including one that
    prevented installing a new version on top of an old one. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/31 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the display of subtitles for demos. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that caused the subtitles to stop half way
    through the Introductory Tour. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/7 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes dropping a negative number on a text pad produced
    odd results. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/12 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Trucks will no longer start to drive if power is off (F8). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">F8 won't stop them if they are already running. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can put a text pad in a truck and it'll end up in the new
    house. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug when doing puzzles that sometimes crashed when
    blowing up the house or entering the rocket. (introduced on 1/26) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you use -puzzle to specify which puzzle and that puzzle
    depends upon the previous puzzle for the items on the floor of the house then there is
    nothing there now. Used to be you'd seen the stuff from the last puzzle you did. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you run demos with narration on a machine without a sound
    card the system could crash. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/16 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where when Marty is describing a robot whose
    thought bubble includes blank boxes it could crash. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a truck with stuff inside on the notebook it
    lost the stuff inside. (Also if you dropped a loaded truck on the stack of trucks in Tooly
    it was returned.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you copied a truck some of the stuff inside wasn't
    copied. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robot's now have serial numbers visible on their chests. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/17 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzles that required the saving of very large amount of
    state behaved erratically. For example, in p42.pzl if the nest contains more than 1000
    numbers it used to cause problems. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/18 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 6B released. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/1 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copied a picture with a wand in &quot;original&quot;
    mode then the things on the back were also restored. For example, the Ping Pong ball so it
    would not bounce. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Adjusted the way mouse movements are mapped to ToonTalk
    movements to increase sensitivity when window is small and screen is big. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/6 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained holding a magic wand (as is the case
    for many puzzles) and the wand was set down and later picked up and used then sometimes
    robots got mixed up. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots sometimes held magic wands behind them looked stupid. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now put trucks, notebooks, robots, and bombs in
    boxes. Robots can be trained to use these things. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now drop a notebook in a truck and that will be the
    notebook used by the robots in the new house. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk to Java translator now works for everything except
    pictures, sounds, and remote controls. If you pause ToonTalk while holding a robot or
    truck, then a corresponding Java applet will be created and displayed. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can also drop a text pad in a truck and it'll end up in
    the new house. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you put a text pad in a truck and then generate a Java
    applet it will get its name from the text pad rather than generating one. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/7 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug with trucks that are stopped (F8) and fully
    loaded and animations are finished instantly. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk to Java translator can now handle the random number
    remote. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/10 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a robot had a remote control in its thought
    bubble that has been erased (by Dusty). Sometimes system would crash when blowing up a
    house with such a robot in it. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/14 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Toontalk to Java translator now generates comments as
    well. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/19 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty can talk! Only in the 32 bit version though. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/20 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed recently introduced bug where Marty would reject many
    correct puzzle solutions. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/21 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can no longer break boxes apart by dropping them on a number
    while doing puzzles. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty tries to repeat what he was saying before you left
    the rocket (in puzzles) he now doesn't repeat as much. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text to speech now works with sound on (though sound is
    turned off when Marty is around). (Waiting for Microsoft SAPI 3.0 to deal with this well.)
    </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/22 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty doesn't repeat himself as much now. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">colour palette changed to leave Windows the 20 colors it
    wants. </font></li>
</ol>

</ol>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Redid the Swedish version of puzzle #41. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Narrations now are in the language ToonTalk is running in
    unless overridden in toontalk.ini by specifying a value for SubtitlesSuffix. (UST for
    English and SET for Swedish now.) </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/26 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Redid Ping Pong demo part 3. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robot on the back of pictures no longer run unless the
    picture is dropped on the floor. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/27 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pause dialog no longer gives confusing warning about losing
    stuff not in Notebook. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Speech to text now has an option in the notebook on page 10
    for controlling it. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Narration of demos in the 32 bit version sometimes would
    interrupt itself. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/30 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs in various puzzles. </font></li>
</ol>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Redid the autostart application (CDROM only) to offer an
    installation choice on the first screen. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you leave the rocket speech now stops (and sound effects
    are restored regardless). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">PageDown now works with speech as well. Current sentence is
    interrupted and Marty skips to the next. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/7 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Greatly improved the synchrnoization between Marty's talk
    balloons and spoken speech. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">While training a robot the robot can now move offscreen a bit
    used to be you sometimes couldn't pick up something you dropped near the edge. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot trained to pick up and drop the whole toolbox got
    mixed up. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a special message from Marty after solving a puzzle
    was lost. (E.g. sometimes after p16.pzl). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the way Marty said Swedish numbers between

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robot serial numbers over 1000 now look better. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes sound effects were lost if left a room while Marty
    was talking (out loud). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if you start with a particular puzzle (using
    -puzzle on the command line) then the things you make were placed at the wrong place in
    the rocket. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if you start with a particular puzzle (using
    -puzzle on the command line) then you would reach a puzzle that depends upon stuff made
    earlier. Now a warning and advice is given. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have a nest in your pocket and a robot is repeatedly
    giving the bird something then you'll now see the bird deliver the stuff to you and
    return. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving the state of puzzles after puzzle 40. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">City is now smaller when running puzzles. </font></li>

    the magic wand from a robot who has been trained to set it down. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/11 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you train a robot to drop something in a hole, and then
    vacuum away (or erase) the whole box from his thought bubble and give him a box with fewer
    holes you now get a reasonable error message. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/13 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way ToonTalk internally keeps track of what
    scene an object is currently part of. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug when blowing up the house in puzzle p53.pzl </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty now describes boxes with many short sentences rather
    than one long one. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that happened when you stood up holding a box
    while a robot was working on the box. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying large boxes (100s or 1000s of
    holes). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Set a maximum number of holes for a box since the system
    slows down terribly as they get to be several 1000 long. 2048 is the max now. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/14 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you used Dusty in reverse while over a stack (in the
    toolbox or a notebook) then copies of the stack item were made. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped the wand and then mouse clicked without moving
    the mouse sometimes you got the thing last pointed to by the tip of the wand. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In high resolution (-v 25) with a hat sometimes the hat was
    wrapped around so that the edge of it was behind his head. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the programmer has the nest in his/her pocket and flies
    the helicopter the bird now flies there if needed. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/15 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the arm wasn't quite attached to the hand properly.
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Redid bank account demo. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed 32bit implementation so that EXE files are about 1M
    smaller. (They share the file &quot;resind&quot; with the 16 bit version.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text to speech (32 bit only) sometimes turned off sound
    effects even though Marty didn't appear. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs with text-to-speech and sound effects switching. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/16 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A bird on the floor when given something didn't quite return
    to where she started but drifted. No longer. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The user profile USR and LOG files now on Win 95 can be over
    200 characters long. Previously (and still in Win 3.1) if 2 users shared the first 8
    letters they were considered the same user. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If training a robot in a puzzle with a training counter it no
    longer counts if you just drop or pick up the magic wand. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/19 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Used to be if you dropped something into a truck that was in
    a box it would crash. Thanks to Katherine Nelson for reporting this. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes things inside of a box that was on a notebook page
    didn't display right. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a new problem where Marty (with speech off) would put
    several sentences in a talk balloon with a small font. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/21 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the 32 bit version where on some machines if
    you paused and returned some images were clobbered. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On some machines the first Ping Pong demo took a very long
    time in the titles. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If puzzle files are not installed on the hard disk but are on
    the CDROM, it now reads them from the CDROM. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/22 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are running off the CDROM and your drive is fast
    enough you can now remove the TempDir entry from toontalk.ini and ToonTalk will no longer
    load files from the CDROM to temporary hard drive files. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">It used to be that if you put the Toolbox down offscreen that
    you couldn't pick him up again. Now a little bit is always visible and it is graspable. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty no longer mentions that text objects that spell a sound
    can be used to make the sound since this is this way of making sounds is being phased out.
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with puzzle p51 where the number became
    exactly 3000 rather than larger. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty now does a better job of describing the clipboard
    remote control. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Once again if you change the size or position of the toolbox
    or the tools that live inside him (Dusty, Pumpy, etc.) then when you restart ToonTalk the
    tools will be the size and position you indicated. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the 32 bit version would lose sound effects if the
    text-to-speech engine couldn't initialize properly. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you start up ToonTalk, pause it, click on come back later
    and then start up ToonTalk again with the same user name then the old ToonTalk is
    activated. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/23 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Training a robot to put a notebook in a truck caused multiple
    problems. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots got confused if you trained one to put a nest on the
    floor and then put things in the nest. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you change the size of the Tool Box then the items inside
    get a smaller or bigger normal size when retrieved. This is now also true for robots that
    remove things from the Tool Box. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to vacuum up the main notebook, or
    send it off in a truck with a robot that blows up that house then ToonTalk crashed since
    the main notebook was destroyed. No longer. </font></li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robot's using magic wands now drop things more accurately. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty described scales strangely. Thanks to Lennart and
    Tobias for pointing this out. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/7 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where things on top of nests inside of boxes
    sometimes displayed themselves with the wrong size. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was contained in something (a box or a truck)
    which was in a notebook and the robot was trained to get something out of a notebook then
    he didn't use the notebook he came from. Does now. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when the sensor notebook is opened and the keyboard
    is heavily used then a bit of memory was accessed that shouldn't. Debugging tools caught
    this but not clear if there are any symptoms. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/8 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The 16 bit version of ToonTalk cannot import pictures that
    are bigger than 64K and only if they have 256 colors. Marty now gives a warning and
    nothing is imported. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On a few systems exiting ToonTalk with Alt-F4 caused a Direct
    Draw error. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you set off a bomb and then quickly pressed
    &quot;Esc&quot; to stand up, sometimes the house would not explode until you went back
    inside. But then Tooly the ToolBox doesn't make it out OK. Fixed now. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes copying something in the thought bubble of a robot
    crashes the system. No longer. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot trained to drop a box on a number sometimes got
    confused. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A sensor all by itself on a notebook page was the wrong size.
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a truck with a robot inside on a notebook
    sometimes a copy of the robot stayed around until you left the floor. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/12 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed many ToonTalk to Java bugs. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The generated Java code can now be run as an applet or as an
    application. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/14 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A bird sometimes forgot to deliver something. If it then
    returned to a house that blew up the item was destroyed improperly. Could lead to a crash.
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various problems associating with shift-clicking text
    when text-to-speech is available. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that occurred when more than 128 things were
    on the screen at once. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed many ToonTalk to Java bugs dealing with trucks. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/15 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When things collided then there was a 50% chance that the
    sensor would detect it one frame later. So if you wanted them both to react to the
    collision the delayed one might not still be colliding on the next frame. Thanks to Kevin
    O'Brien for pointing out this problem. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If 2 objects were moving very quickly relative to their size
    then they used to be able to pass through each other without a collision detector
    noticing. No longer. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/17 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sentence maker demo on the last page of the example notebook
    on page 6 was enhanced. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 7C released. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Finished major re-write of Java classes for running
    translated ToonTalk. No longer heavily uses Java threads. Display of results improved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/22</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. Fixed a bug where
    a robot lost track of stuff when something was put in a box, taken out, and then something
    was put into it.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">After training a robot, the limits on how far your arm can go
    offscreen were not restored so it was easy to move your arm off screen and
    &quot;lose&quot; it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was working somewhere in the city and sending key
    strokes to the main notebook (looking for a page), then if you picked up the notebook you
    stopped the robot. Also the robot running elsewhere messed up the size of the items on the
    first pages of the notebook temporarily.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a notebook shared by lots of robots in
    different houses is destroyed. (Demo2 of Sentence Maker example could trigger this after
    waiting long enough in heliocopter while it is running.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/25</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. Fixed a bug with
    the sensor for detecting if the control button was down.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/26</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a text pad was sent off in a truck and then
    the new house with the pad was visited. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes while exiting ToonTalk while tools are coming out
    of Tooly system would crash.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fix on 5/22 where robot lost track of stuff broke when a
    robot dropped things on a number (or text pad) on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a few problems with ToonTalk to Java translator when
    magic wand was used more than once without setting it down.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird comes back to a box to find it now occupied, she'll
    fly around and wait. If you then got up (or set off a bomb) the system crashed. Also she
    flew around in a goofy manner.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird is returning to a box that has been vacuumed she
    now stops.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a notebook page contains something that uses collision
    detection and you leave that page the system used to crash. Problem introduced on 5/15.
    (Thanks to dcornell for pointing this out.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug from 5/22 where while training a robot it can be
    way off-screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a robot during training picks up a
    many-holed box and it gets wider and wider.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many small changes to the way Marty describes things,
    especially remote controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/2</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes Marty when talking about pictures would include a )
    when there was no (.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Translator to Java now supports pictures and sounds. Nearly
    everything (all the example programs for example) now run fine in a Web browser.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 7D released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java equivalents of ToonTalk programs that use pictures (e.g.
    Ping Pong) run about twice as fast now.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java now supports global sensors for keyboard and mouse.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained with a box with a sensor with a text
    display (like shift button down sensor) then in the thought bubble it was replaced with
    the empty string. It is now replaced by a string corresponding to its last state. If this
    isn't what is desired one can always replace the text in the thought bubble.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Add new kinds of synthetic images. In addition to rectangles
    the pictures notebook now contains ovals, lines, rounded rectangles, etc.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java now queries the user for values if an empty box hole is
    matched against something. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is a rectangle with pictures on top and its
    visibility is set to see some then the pictures on top will be visible and the rectangle
    will not. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/23 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">It once again works to drop a flipped picture on top of a
    flipped picture. The picture underneath will act as if all the robots and boxes have been
    dropped on it. This is a very useful way of adding or combining behaviors. If you train a
    robot by giving him boxes containing remote controls they automatically are erased for the
    thought bubble. This now also works if you remove the box from his thought bubble and
    replace it. If you flip over a picture with pictures on top then its notebook contains a
    copy of the pictures on top and a notebook for each one. The copies now have robots and
    boxes on the back if the original did.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk to Java translator now uses labels on boxes to
    generate prompts if needed. If a box is empty or contains a nest without a bird and it is
    matched against some value then the user is asked for a value. The label under that hole
    is used if there is one. If a bird without nest is given something its nest will be
    labeled by the label in the hole the bird is in. If there are no labels a generic message
    is used.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the Ping Pong demos caused by the
    addition of new pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When text-to-speech is used without talk balloons Marty would
    sometimes leave before finishing what he was saying.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The remote control for looks now behaves properly when made
    blank and given a new appearance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The remote control for looks now becomes a controller of the
    picture whose back it is dropped on.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Flipped pictures did not always clip the pictures on the back
    properly so, for example, thought bubbles sometimes stuck out behind the edge of the
    flipped picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Things on the back of pictures are now automatically laid out
    in tiling fashion.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot on the back of a picture loads up a truck with
    another robot and box then they now end up on the back of the picture as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot on the back of a picture loses the box he is
    working on (e.g. he was vacuumed it up or put it in a truck for another robot to work on)
    then he also disappears from the back of the picture since he can no longer do anything.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a trained robot picked something up and changed
    it (e.g. the number of holes of a box) and released it the size would be wrong.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Redid Ping Pong Demo (part 3).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk is now more responsive to mouse movements (maximum
    speed in various contexts has been reduced). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Marty needs to say something that he can't speak (an error
    message from MCI for now) he will switch to using talk balloons for a minute.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Make some error messages more important (so they come through
    even if Marty's default talk level is increased to 4).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8 released</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/1</font><a name="Beta8A"></a> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug with birds and exploding houses (e.g. sentences
    demo) that crashed system.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bug in translator to Java when making something empty
    (e.g. a hole of a box).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in translator to Java when a notebook has a truck
    with a robot in it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in translator to Java when a robot uses a
    notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can no longer vacuum things out of a remote control
    notebook of a picture. (Thanks to Katherine Nelson for pointing out this problem.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On puzzle #49 (blow up the other house) if you blew up the
    wrong house and went back to the rocket the system would crash. No longer. (Thanks to
    Katherine Nelson for pointing out this problem.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When in puzzle #62 you flipped the number, the system
    crashed. No longer. (Thanks to Katherine Nelson for pointing out this problem.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robot picked up a box it gradually grew
    wider and wider. No longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Windows was running with more than 256 colors, then the
    16 bit version showed the subtitles as black on black. (Thanks to Katherine Nelson for
    pointing out this problem.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Windows was running with more than 256 colors, when
    exiting the 32 bit version full-screen mode then errors would occur and leave Windows with
    256 colors.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the release information on the opening screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed one of the images of Tooly, the toolbox, settling down.
    Used to have a purple fringe.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now when ToonTalk is running in full-screen mode and loses
    the focus (e.g. Alt-Tab or Ctrl-Esc or another application grabbing it), you now get a
    specialized dialog for the occasion. Also if Windows was running more than 256 colors, it
    used to be reset to 256 colors when this happened.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when two robots were working together and the
    programmer wasn't watching either one, then one of them would lose track of things and
    stop. Fixed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java translator had a problem if a notebook containing a
    truck containing a robot was encountered.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">F9 now only hides your hand and arm but not what you are
    holding.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8A released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/9</font><a name="Beta8B"></a> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If StartTT.exe has problems launching ToonTalk it now
    describes the problem in the file c:\StartTT.log</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">StartTT didn't work right if ToonTalk was installed so that
    the path name contained too many characters.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a problem occurred while running a puzzle then starting
    again sometimes caused the same problem. Fixed at least for some of the special puzzles
    that depend upon earlier puzzles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk is started on a puzzle that requires things from
    an earlier puzzle but they aren't available it now offers to send you back a few puzzles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8A introduced a bug where if ToonTalk wanted to put up a
    message box, then it would first put up the &quot;pause dialog&quot;. Fixed now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Began using Microsoft Speech SDK 3.0. Text-to-speech handles
    apostrophes differently so needed to change ToonTalk accordingly.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If any file is missing from the hard disk, ToonTalk now reads
    it from the CDROM (if it was installed from a CDROM). It now asks the user to insert the
    CDROM if it is not.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an argument to the -language switch is unknown then the
    first 2 letters are taken to be the country code and files named XXttYY.dll and
    XXsttYY.dll (where XX is the country code and YY is 16 or 32 depending upon which version
    of ToonTalk is being loaded) are loaded. This permits a released version of ToonTalk to be
    localized after the fact.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug when &quot;taking control&quot; of a demo how you
    can't pause it properly after that.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk was trying to ask for the CDROM
    but didn't have the string library loaded yet.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Finished complete re-write of installation program. Can
    install and un-install separate components. Should be more robust and flexible than old
    one. And it looks more &quot;modern&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where the toolbox didn't make it out of an
    exploding house when the power was off. (Thanks to Katherine Nelson for pointing out this
    problem.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug in reading the history of
    user. May have caused strange behavior on Windows NT 4.0.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many small improvements to the wording of what Marty says.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty describes a sensor that has been operated upon
    (e.g. &quot;\2&quot; was dropped on it) then he interrupted his description with some
    advice. The sentence order now makes sense.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets if a robot flipped
    something over while holding it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with some of the comments generated for Java.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with some of the comments generated for Java
    in Swedish.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Even though most puzzles disable typing of text (too easy to
    cheat) ToonTalk allowed typing anyway. (Thanks to Tobias Zetterlund for pointing this
    out.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk also allowed pictures to be flipped even if a puzzle
    switch disabled this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various bugs that interfered with puzzles 63, 64 and
    65.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the policy about pictures (or numbers) with robots on
    the back. They no longer stop when picked up or dropped in a box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A box with a picture with robots on the back now starts
    working when taken out of a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle 61 allowed players to bring any number back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Expanded the hints in puzzle 65.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/27</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the argument to -I on the command line contained an
    extension (.DMO) then it would only work if it was a fully-qualified path name. No longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added 5 more puzzles.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a number was flipped over twice, then put in a notebook
    and then taken out and dropped on a picture the number and the underlying number pad were
    added to the picture. Now just the number is added.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added 4 more puzzles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">After solving the last puzzle you needed to come back to
    Marty for him to tell you so. If you solved all the puzzles and start &quot;Play
    Game&quot; then you are now given the option of starting over again.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The command line now permits file names (e.g. puzzle or demo
    names) to have spaces in them as many Windows 95 files do. Do not use - in names however
    as that may confuse things.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where system crashed sometimes during training a
    robot during puzzles if the robot picked up the box it was given.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle #54 now works by waiting for the bird to deliver the
    message.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Used to be you could make a team of robots some of who
    haven't been trained yet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzles that involve results that are dynamic (have robots on
    the back) are now checked properly. And Marty responds appropriately to different sorts of
    wrong dynamic answers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot is starting to work on a box or is waiting for a
    sensor to change and the box is near the top of the screen the robot would go off the top
    of the screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Flipping a picture back over with robots on the back now
    starts them up (used to be that you had to drop it first).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Flipping a picture over used to stop the robots on the back
    for good. Now they are stopped only until it is flipped back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes dynamic things posted on the wall of the broken
    rocket stopped running after a while.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If successive puzzles left the solution in your hand for the
    next puzzle and you reset (bombed) the house sometimes you got a previous thing in your
    hand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would not jump to the next sentence when really
    speaking when a player clicked the mouse inside the rocket.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you solve the last puzzle Marty now says new things and
    as a present adds your age in seconds to the sensor notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots now have generated names (unless the
    GenerateRobotNames switch in toontalk.ini has been set to 0). Thanks to Jerry Balzano for
    the suggestion.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the system crashed while the Java
    applet generator tried to generate long comments (describing complex items).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various bugs when generating a Java applet that has
    robots on the back of a picture that in turn is in a box on the back of another picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets didn't quite do the right thing when scales were
    used with numbers with robots on the back.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various Java applet bugs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets of numbers or text with robots on the back no
    longer generate a picture of the number (that didn't look good anyway).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets that didn't generate a picture flickered badly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now run (and compile) using archives. This among
    other things means they can run off the CDROM which doesn't have long file names.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is now an internal list of &quot;bad&quot; robot names
    that are not used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs in Java applets that used operations on remote
    controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now work if the robot was trained to use the
    main notebook (that lives inside Tooly).</font></li>
</ol>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a box on a picture and then vacuumed it out it
    didn't quite behave like a box anymore. You no longer can add a box to a picture. Thanks
    to Tobias Zetterlund for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in Java applets when a robot was trained to
    change the pages of a notebook without picking it up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with Java applets when a robot was trained to
    change the colour of a synthetic picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with Java applets when a robot changed
    notebook pages in certain ways.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Java pictures and sounds needed for Java applets using
    them can now reside on either the hard disk or CD-ROM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If after copying something (e.g. a number) a robot was
    trained to use the keyboard while still holding the wand with the attached item, then the
    corresponding Java applet didn't work. Also Marty described the robot incorrectly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In both ToonTalk and Java applets if a random number had some
    operations performed (e.g. adding 1000) and it was copied then the copy did not have the
    operations performed until the next cycle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets that use pictures can now run either in a
    separate window or inside the browser. The Switch &quot;RunAppletInNewWindow&quot; in
    ToonTalk.ini controls this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets now by default receive their name from the first
    robot involved.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug that prevented Start ToonTalk
    from starting demos because the names had a space added at the end. Preceeding and
    trailing spaces in file names are now ignored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The compilation of Java applets can now occur with the needed
    files on the CDROM.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with training robots to drop pictures on
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with trained robots flipping a picture over
    and using the remote controls in the picture's notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The compilation of the Java applet can now use a compiler on
    the CD-ROM if one has not been installed on the hard disk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made minor improvements to the installation script.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made minor improvements to the wording of puzzles #61 and
    #62.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The command line -puzzle &lt;file_name&gt; has been extended
    to allow -puzzle &lt;puzzle_number&gt; as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Revised puzzle #51 so that the second number can be greater
    than OR EQUAL TO 3000 now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Revised puzzle #68 so it differs from #67 only in the use of
    the keyboard to initialize the numbers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On puzzle #64 the robot had an invisible wand (actually it
    was 0 units tall).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Blank pages added to the end of notebooks are now ignored. It
    used to be that you could not return a notebook to a stack if you had flipped past the
    last non-blank page.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets did not work if a robot was trained to add
    things to a remote control for the looks of something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets did not work if a robot was trained to get a
    notebook from a picture and use the remote controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Dusty is turned on to reverse to restore things that he
    erased he did too many all at once. He now waits a second between each restoration.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the way power off (F8) is displayed so that it still
    is obvious but it looks better. (Permutes colors rather than draw a black mask on top.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Recovers better from errors while generating Java applets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Deals better with missing media when generating Java applets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a user closed the box asking his or her name then the
    string library was left open. This wasted resources and interferes with installation.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8B released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><a name="Beta8C"></a><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a misspelling in puzzle #62 and
    ran a spell checker on puzzles 61 to 74.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed &quot;dottled&quot; to &quot;dotted&quot; in Pictures
    notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the wording of puzzle #67. (&quot;minute&quot; to
    &quot;minutes timer&quot;)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated the text-to-speech engine with new things Marty says.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you haven't used ToonTalk for a while, you now get a
    dialog box asking you if you want to Marty to suggest things that you once did but might
    have forgotten.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty when speaking would occasionally get stuck -- fixed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you shrank the magic wand and then copied things that were
    inside of other things the copies ended up floating off the bottom of the screen. Thanks
    to Magnus Knutsson&nbsp;for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you broke a blank box (either by keyboarding a smaller
    number of holes or dropping it on a small number) then only one piece was blank and the
    other not.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copied a blank box and then changed the number of
    holes in the copy an error occurred.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now control your persona by using a joystick (as well
    as a mouse or the arrow keys). 32-bit version only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/19</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk had troubles loading something that was in a
    truck it looped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk had troubles loading blank notebooks inside of other
    things.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The internal workings of sensors and remote controls was
    re-worked to be more extensible and faster.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have one or more joysticks connected to your PC and
    you are running the 32-bit version of ToonTalk then at the end of your sensor notebook
    you'll find a sensor notebook for the state and buttons of the joystick.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug when StartTT is running in auto demo mode when a
    demo finished it might violate memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another problem running auto demo mode where at the end
    of each demo a dialog box appeared saying ToonTalk was stopped by another program (it was
    the StartTT program).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Extra joystick buttons (and middle and right mouse buttons)
    are now user customizable by adding entries in <a href="ttini.htm#ButtonEquivalents">toontalk.ini</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/23</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk would be interrupted by another problem,
    put up an appropriate dialog box but then crash when resumed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Joystick sensors are now natural language sensitive
    (&quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; are localized).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a connected joystick isn't calibrated then when the 32-bit
    version is started the helicopter drifts off to an edge. This is now detected and a dialog
    explaining what to do about this is started.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way in which ToonTalk put up a message box and
    restored things afterwards.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensor <a href="sensor.htm#SoundFile">File to Sound</a>
    was enhanced so that you can remove a sound from it and use it (by pressing the space bar)
    to make sounds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">2 new sensors were added to the sensor notebook (on page 4). <a
    href="sensor.htm#TextToSpeech">Text to Speech</a> works on the 32-bit version of ToonTalk
    and will speak the text (or spell it if the words aren't known). <a
    href="sensor.htm#TextToMCI">Text to MCI</a> sends the text on the pad to Microsoft's Media
    Controller Interface. For both of these you can vacuum off the sound (or other media) and
    just use it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless overridden by -new_input 0 on the command line, when
    you type while holding or pointing to a sound, then the sound is made. You can no longer
    make text be spoken or send it to MCI -- instead you should use the sensors described
    above.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak in the 32-bit version.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The second mouse button (or second joystick button) now flips
    over pictures, text, and numbers (if -b 2).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you change the <a href="remote.htm#WhichPicture">Which
    Picture</a> number from a notebook on the back of a flipped over number or text pad then
    the number (like with geometric objects) changes the colour of the text.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several memory leaks</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with reading narration files from a CDROM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the colour of text and sound pads when
    too small to have text.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if a team of robots was on the back of
    a picture that all but the first robot was very narrow.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty would say &quot;the a picture
    of&quot; or &quot;the a movie of&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced but where robots lost track of
    things when trained to change the size of a box using the keyboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a team of more than 2 robots stopped, then when you picked
    up one they didn't form a line again until dropped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced but in the global mouse speed
    sensors that showed much too small a value.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug in generating a Java applet
    from a ToonTalk program that uses remote controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Discovered that the optimized version of TT32 had a bug that
    showed up on the first puzzle. Changed the optimization settings and problem is gone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where if you grabbed Dusty while he was morphing
    to inert then he was inert in your hand.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in new input scheme for how to use Pumpy with the
    right mouse button.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with running user added demos that lack
    narration and subtitles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a user is asked to insert the CDROM and agrees but clicks
    on &quot;retry&quot; before the disk has spun up they now get another chance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various bugs in the new input scheme (using the right
    mouse button).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8C released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/8</font><a name="Beta9"></a> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where a robot trained to use
    Dusty didn't behave right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where Marty would repeatedly say why a robot
    stopped if many were stopping for the same reason.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty says a robot stopped he now gives the robot's
    name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty is speaking (text-to-speech) sometimes he would
    get stuck with a blank talk balloon or break a word across balloons.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots got mixed up sometimes when they were trained to drop
    a text pad on a notebook (other than the main one).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was being trained and was holding another robot or
    the like and</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk was paused then a Java applet was generated --
    should only work when the programmer is holding it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you took control from a demo then the old input scheme was
    in effect. No longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">While training a robot if a notebook other than the main was
    picked up then its size was made too small.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds some times were not made by robots on the back of
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds were sometimes stopped prematurely by robots.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated the robot across from the &quot;Say&quot; page of the
    Sentences notebook in the Examples notebook to work with the new sound primitives.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem pausing on the opening screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The 32-bit version didn't release a library resource.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a variety of memory leaks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now sit down outside and whatever you leave on the
    ground will be add to the city. (To call the helicopter you can no longer click a mouse
    button since that is for sitting. 'H' and 'h' still call it.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots on the back of pictures kept working even when the
    flipping the picture over. Caused confusion.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you add to the &quot;User&quot; section of toontalk.ini an
    entry DefaultUser=&lt;name&gt; then the user profile and notebooks of name will be
    available to new users. This is a good way to customize ToonTalk for a group.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now use left and right mouse buttons together to act
    like &quot;escape&quot; to stand up or leave a thought bubble. Works only if -b &lt;n&gt;
    where n is greater than 1.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bomb was set off doing puzzle #6 then the floor of the
    re-built house was empty.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a user quit just after solving puzzle #5 then when
    ToonTalk is restarted puzzle #5 used to have to be re-solved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made various improvements is what Marty says during the first
    puzzle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now get a new hint each time you walk over to Marty
    if he isn't talking just then.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you use Pumpy on a bird she will go back to the size you
    give her after flying or being removed from a box. (Favored size is currently lost when a
    bird is put in a notebook and taken out.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures started to run when taken out of a notebook even if
    the power was off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the warning Marty gives if a robot doesn't accept a
    box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">First time a user generates a Java applet a message box
    appears explaining what is happening.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a bird is returning to a box (perhaps on
    the back of a picture) and the box has in the meanwhile been dropped on a blank page of
    the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text and numbers can now be used to decorate the city (as
    well as pictures).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures now wait a few seconds before running (if robots are
    on the back) after being taken out of a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robot's trained to use tools where the right button was used
    rather than the space bar got confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot trained to use Pumpy got confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Backspace now behaves just like '-' when flipping pages in a
    notebook. Old scheme confused many.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures have been changed. If the image on the picture is
    non-rectangular you only see the image now and not the background and frame. When pointing
    to and holding a picture you now see the image and the border. The meaning of remote
    control for visibility has changed so that &quot;SEE SOME&quot; now means if a picture has
    pictures on top you see them but not the underlying picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Collision detectors now do not sense invisible objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Collision detectors on the back of pictures that are on a
    picture whose visibility is &quot;SEE SOME&quot; now detect objects at the
    &quot;level&quot; of the picture they are on.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">StartTT -autodemo &lt;n&gt; now works even if the application
    is not active (but not if it has been iconized). This is mostly useful for a
    &quot;kiosk&quot; demo mode.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The programmer when walking around the city can walk through
    pictures (decoration) but except for rectangles (which may be invisible).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">This gives flexibility in deciding now solid decorations
    should be. If power is off (via F8) then programmer can walk through fine.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The remote control for &quot;Picture #&quot; (which controls
    the colour for synthetic pictures like ovals and rounded rectangles) used to display
    numbers greater than 255.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some things (like dizzy.tt in the Doc directory and puzzles
    44 and 45) were saved from the ToonTalk clipboard and couldn't be restored by version 8C
    or later (due to a format change).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now see things on the floor when you stand up!</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">And you can move around while on the floor by moving your arm
    off screen!</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk tried to put up a message box before everything
    was initialized then a different message box came up about a problem with DirectDraw.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various new bugs with moving around in the room.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the command line contains -m 0 then no memory is devoted
    to caching files. Used to be as a result sounds (like the helicopter) kept repeating. Also
    some memory leaked when the cache got too full.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes occurred when a bird flew
    outside.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a DirectDraw bug that caused ToonTalk to crash on start
    up in high-resolution on some video cards. (Thanks to Julian Pixton for his help.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem moving around on the ground (Tooly didn't
    behave right.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">While training a robot things are now restored and you can no
    longer move around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Speech used to go off while Marty was around but now only
    when Marty is talking.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If -tts_uses_ds 1 is used then both speaking and sounds work
    but on most test machines there are long delays and a bad hiss. The default is 0.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The speech engine is now initialized during the credits so
    there isn't a long pause before you can enter Marty's rocket when starting up the puzzle
    game.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the Swedish version that caused all demos to
    terminate immediately.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/23</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where the browser was launched before the Java
    applet was completed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">(Still can happen on Windows 3.1 or NT 3.51 -- you'll need to
    do shift-reload of Netscape if applet doesn't start.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Grass is now green when you sit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the animation of the tree decoration.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Flower decoration now comes in 3 colors and also includes
    animation of it browning and recovering.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the way &quot;the z ordering&quot; that determines
    which object is in front of others. Works better in the room and with the tool box
    following you.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bike pump used to be hard to pick up from the top.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bike pump would sometimes not settle down when released.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When training a robot his hand is nearly immobile.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When training a robot he picks things up and holds them in
    his hand now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When training a robot it used to be that if he picked up the
    tool box or the notebook he would leave them looking very small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When moving around on the floor you now see the front wall if
    you move forward far enough.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you move around on the ground then when you stand up you
    have moved appropriately.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made minor improvements to the animation of Marty. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When getting up from the ground only pictures, text, and
    numbers stay behind.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything else disappears (except of course Tooly and his
    contents).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where if you quickly grab something before Bammer
    smashes it then he'll smash it in your hand and the system crashes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Camera doesn't move when hand is hidden now. No interference
    with Ping Pong, for example.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk gave up on speech engine and turned it off
    unnecessarily.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped certain things (like a bird) near a wall of
    the room while on the floor it would jump towards the center.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When holding a bird she now is animated -- used to freeze.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now add a picture to a bird's tee shirt. Because when
    you give a bird a picture she takes it to her nest, the picture must completely fit on top
    of the tee shirt. Using Pumpy to expand the bird and then dropping a picture is
    recommended.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/28</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is now a remote control for adding decoration to the
    wall of the room. It looks like a picture of the wall and you drop stuff on it (or vacuum
    them off) and they like voodoo appear on the wall of the house you are in.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where sound sometimes stopped (if text-to-speech
    was on).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where programmer sometimes stepped on things on

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The draw order (the &quot;z ordering&quot;) of things that

    sometimes things were in front of other things and some times behind.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">There are now 2 new remote controls. One for decorating the
    front of a house and the other for decorating the roof of a house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some pictures acted as if they were much bigger than they
    appeared (since they can change to that). Also meant that when picked up they sometimes

</ol>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now save birds with tee-shirts in notebooks.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">With -b 2 or more (mouse buttons shortcuts enabled), used to
    be that if you pointed to the stack of bombs in the toolbox and clicked the right button
    the stack of bombs would go off and crash ToonTalk.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Saving a city now saves the programmer's location as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the geometry of things in the notebook (some were too
    small -- teams of robots were too big).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored the default for -b to 1. In other words, by default
    any mouse button can be used to pick up and drop. Space bar is available for using what
    you've picked up.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some memory leaks. Especially bad when running the
    sentences demo.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you save in the notebook a box that contains pictures and
    remote controls then they are saved so that when retrieved from the notebook the same
    relationships hold. Also when you copy a box like that then the copy has remote controls
    for the copy not the original.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to set off a bomb by pointing to a
    bomb (not holding it) and typing space (or right mouse button if enabled) then the robot
    was confused when run. You now once again must be holding a bomb to set it off. Thanks to

    the ground.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where after you got up from the ground you looked
    as if you were floating on top of other things.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/21</font> 

<ol>

    launch ToonTalk with that city. You can also specify which city with -city &lt;file
    name&gt; on the command line.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/22</font></li>

    remote controls on the back. (E.g. the Ping Pong example.)</font></li>

    wand and the wand became very big.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/23</font> 

<ol>

    still attached to it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">F3 now works during puzzles 25 and 26.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty is speaking something that contains a
    parenthetical remark he some times skipped part of it. Now he skips the whole thing.</font></li>

    with running demos.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 9 released.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/24</font><a name="Beta9A"></a> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">16-bit version was confused about command line when options
    were set and an old user name used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">16-bit version could try to start in high-resolution but many
    things looked wrong.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Object on the ground disappeared when you moved your hand
    enough so that the camera moved.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you leave while Marty is talking during &quot;Play
    Game&quot; and come back he explains that he had more to say last time but didn't say it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally Marty tried to say &quot; &quot; and put up a
    little empty talk balloon.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you resumed playing the game, then numbers and text pads
    on the wall of the rocket were lacking the pad part -- just the characters showed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty used to give hints when you walked over to him during
    puzzle play even if it was the start of the puzzle and you haven't left the rocket since
    hearing the puzzle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Standing up while holding the toolbox in your hand led to
    confusion. Now it is dropped automatically when standing.</font></li>

    users due to the fact that the 16-bit and 32-bit versions believed they were in different
    time zones!</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Patch from Beta 9 to 9A released. (Yes, it does have 4

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you used a user picture to decorate the roof of a house it
    was the wrong size.</font></li>

    back the helicopter didn't work right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you left certain kinds of remote controls on the floor
    (like the decoration remote, or clipboard or file to X kind) then they ended up very very
    narrow.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzles where a robot starts off holding a magic wand had the

    choice where the name of the language is translated appropriately.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many remote controls that show pictures (like the &quot;File
    to Picture&quot;) now show a black background with a white frame.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The implementation of selection feedback was completely
    re-written. Should avoid cases where thin white or black horizontal or vertical lines

<ol>

    indicate which directory then the &quot;Users&quot; directory of the ToonTalk installation
    is used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When training a robot (or when one is waiting) they aren't
    quite as frantic now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a truck was driving outside and seen from the side there
