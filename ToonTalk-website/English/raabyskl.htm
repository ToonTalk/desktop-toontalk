<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Råbyskolan is a an elementary school with an
ethnic mixture of kids from all over the world. The school board has set up a budget for
testing ToonTalk as means of letting the kids develop skills in for example math and
physics. The testing will be supervised and supported by the Stockholm Institute of
Education, Birgitta Lindahl. Teacher trainees from the Insitute will assist the teachers
in Råbyskolan as part of their training. The activities of the project will be
coordinated by Lennart Mogren <a href="mailto:lennart.mogren@swipnet.se">Click here</a> to
send Lennart email. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A few groups of kids have started learning basic
ToonTalk programming and the two teachers, Barbro Mogren and Elsie-Marie Zetterlund, are
learning too. Elsie-Marie's sixteen year old son Tobias will be their mentor. They all met
Ken Kahn in April at Råbyskolan. (<a href="kenatbro.htm">Click here </a>to see a photo
from that visit.) The testing period will end in mid-December. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We'd like to share ToonTalk files with other beta
testers around the globe! </font></p>
