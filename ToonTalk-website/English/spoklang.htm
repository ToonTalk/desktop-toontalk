      <P>Do you want to change which language ToonTalk speaks? For ToonTalk use by 
         WebLabs in Sweden and Portugal (and other countries when ToonTalk is 
         translated), I recommend you try using English as the spoken language. This is 
         due the lack of an adequate text-to-speech engine in Swedish or European 
         Portuguese. If you have already chosen English as the display language then 
         English is already the default spoken language as well.</P>
      <P align="center"><input id="Button1" onclick="window.returnValue = '-set_option(User,SpokenLanguage,English) -accept_settings';window.close()" type="button" value="Use English as the spoken language" name="Button1"><input id="Button2" onclick="window.returnValue = '-set_option(User,SpokenLanguage, ) -accept_settings';window.close()" type="button" value="Do NOT use English as the spoken language" name="Button1">
      </P>
      <P align="left">If you want to customize ToonTalk in other ways, then click on 
         'Set Options' in the ToonTalk start screen.</P>
