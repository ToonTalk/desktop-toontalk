<p align="center"><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" style="font-size: larger">
Enhancements in</font></strong><big><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS"> ToonTalk 
Version 3</font></strong></big></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk version 3 includes these improvements 
over version 2:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Arbitrarily large integers and exact rational
    arithmetic.</strong> The size of numbers in ToonTalk 3 is only limited only by the amount
    of memory available. Numbers with millions of digits are possible. Exact fractional
    values are&nbsp;also supported. These numbers can be spoken as well. <a href="newnum.htm">Click here</a> for details.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Time travel.</strong> This is a way to move back and
    forward in time while using ToonTalk. It provides a new way of replaying some actions,
    undoing mistakes and making enhanced demos.&nbsp; <a href="ttravel.htm">An experimental
    implementation</a> of this is in version 2 but there are situations where it 
  didn't work reliably.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Full 32-bit color.</strong> ToonTalk 2 reduces every
    picture to a palette of 256 colors. You can run ToonTalk 3 at any color depth.
    Both the built-in artwork and your imported images will look better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>A new HTML-based interface for all dialogs.</strong>
    The new dialogs  look nicer and are more flexible. Perhaps most importantly,
    administrators (e.g. teachers, parents, museum curators) can add or remove available
    options using any HTML editor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Incorporation of <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/msagent">Microsoft Agent</a> into the documentation and
    dialog screens.</strong> Animated help characters who speak will be optionally available
    to help users with dialog screens and on-line documentation.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>XML-based format for saving and loading ToonTalk
    objects.</strong> For advanced users this provides a way to make global changes to their
    creations. It will also support the creation of new ToonTalk tools by third parties.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Automatic packaging of user images and 
  sounds when saving and loading ToonTalk objects.</b> Users can bring pictures 
  and sounds into ToonTalk and easily export games and applications using this 
  media without worry about file names, packaging, or compression.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ability to edit text and labels using arrow 
  keys.</font></b></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Ability to edit pictures. </b>Users with two 
  clicks run their favorite picture editor on something they are holding in 
  ToonTalk. The edited picture is automatically brought into ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Full support for tablet PCs and touch screens.</strong>
    Version 3  supports an interface using a tablet or touch panel without using a mouse or
    other pointing device.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Plus hundreds of other enhancements.</strong> Perhaps
    as important as the major enhancements listed above are the hundreds of smaller
    enhancements that  make ToonTalk 3 easier to use and learn.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk 3 also includes the learning material 
developed by the European <a href="weblabs_project.htm">WebLabs Project </a>and 
games and game components created by the European <a href="playgrnd.htm">
Playground Project</a>.
