<p class="paragraphheading">General overview: Cryptography basics</p>
<p class="mainbody">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="stx">
  <p><span class="paragraphheading">1. Overview</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="mainbody">What are codes?</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="mainbody">What is cryptography? </span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="mainbody">Is there any theory explaining how to create effective codes?</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="mainbody">While studying the topic of codes in a computer science classroom, you may 
  find questions arising regarding the history of this unique field. Exploring 
  how codes came about, and the division of this field into three separate 
  sciences provides an excellent basis for independent study projects. The 
  following provides a brief introduction of Codes, Cryptography, Coding Theory 
  and Information theory.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="parasubheading">Codes</h2>
  <p>  <em class="mainbodyitalic">Definition:</em></p>
  <p class="mainbody">Any set of words, letters, colors, numbers or signs that have special 
  meaning can be considered a code. Not all codes are secret. Codes are used 
  everyday as a quick and easy way of sending messages. </p>
  <p class="mainbodyitalic"><em>Background:</em></p>
  <p class="mainbody">The earliest codes began when people travelled to unknown areas of the 
  world. Traces of the markings and tracks made to guide their way still remain 
  today. Some other types of codes include; semaphore, Morse code, map codes and 
  binary codes.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="parasubheading">Cryptography</p>
  <p class="mainbodyitalic"><em>Definition:</em> </p>
  <p class="mainbody">Cryptology is the science dealing with disguised or secret communications. 
  It encompasses the methods involved in preparing messages or writings intended 
  to be incomprehensible to all except those who legitimately process the means 
  to reproduce the original plain text.</p>
  <p class="mainbodyitalic"><em>Background:</em> </p>
  <p class="mainbody">It is almost impossible to ascertain the origin of cryptographic 
  improvements or development of cryptanalytic techniques due to the secrecy 
  inherent in the science. The earliest cryptology was developed by the 
  Egyptians, ancient Hebrews and Indians. The first recorded use for 
  correspondence was by the Lacedaemonians approximately 400 BC. Julius Ceasar 
  was an avid supporter of this type of communications during his reign. 
  Cryptology came into widespread use in the west during the 1300's, when 
  ambassadors were first assigned to other countries. The invention of the 
  telegraph in the mid 1800's quickly led to the development of military field 
  ciphers. Similarly, in the early 1900's military codes were encrypted before 
  being sent out by radio. Poor cryptography - or good crypto-analysis had 
  dramatic effects of the course of history. Throughout WWI and WWII many 
  battles were won and lost based on information intercepted and decoded by 
  other nations. In 1971 Martin Heilman created the first public-key ciphers 
  making cryptology more accessible to the common person. Since the 1970's the 
  use of cryptography in private business has grown rapidly.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="parasubheading">Coding Theory</h2>
  <p class="mainbodyitalic"><em>Definition:</em></p>
  <p class="mainbody">Coding theory is the science of finding efficient schemes by which digital 
  information can be coded for reliable transmission through a noisy channel.</p>
  <p class="mainbodyitalic"><em>Background:</em></p>
  <p class="mainbody">The birth of coding theory was inspired by the classic paper by Claude 
  Shannon, 'The Mathematical Theory of Communication', first published in the 
  Bell System Technical Journal, in 1948. His ideas gave rise to two whole new 
  subjects, Information theory and coding theory.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="parasubheading">Additional information about 
    Information Theory</p>
  <p class="mainbodyitalic"><em>Definition:</em></p>
  <p class="mainbody">Information theory describes how messages are transmitted and received 
  through such electronic information systems as radio, telephone, television 
  and computer systems. It provides mathematical laws to determine the 
  probability that all the individual parts of a message will be transmitted 
  without distortion. These laws are used to improve the capacity, efficiency 
  and clarity of information systems.</p>
  <p class="mainbodyitalic"><em>Background:</em></p>
  <p class="mainbody">Undisputedly, the father of information theory is Claude Shannon (1948). He 
  characterized the mathematical treatment of problems that arise in the storage 
  and transmission of information. It was his view that information can be 
  treated as any other physical quantity. Shannon's paper explored the 
  quantitative measures of information and of the capacity of various systems to 
  transmit, store and process information.</p>

  <p class="mainbody">11. Combining skills in sequences and coding. Producing complex codes based 
  on sequences.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="paragraphheading">3. Duration</h1>
  <p class="mainbody">The module plan is intended to cover 3 or 4 lessons depending on kids’ 
  response to the subject.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="paragraphheading">4. Methodology</p>
  <p class="mainbody">The activity starts with general talks about coding. Students are asked to 
  recollect examples of coding they know from their own experience, history or 
  movies they saw.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">Introducing some examples by teacher – bar codes, Greek system of 
  representing numbers by letters, coding machine Enigma and amazing stories how 
  mathematicians tried to decode enemy cryptograms during World War II.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">Then we try to figure out an informal definition for coding and eventually 
  for cryptography.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">The kids are shown how the letter could be changed by adding numbers to 
  text pads. An explanation of how letters are represented in a computer and 
  each letter is associated with certain number – ASCII. Also the trick of 
  breaking apart a word on letters is demonstrated as a base to the next phase – coding a word fixed in length letter by letter.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">After the kids have played around enough coding simple words such as “cat” 
  or “dog” the question about automating the coding by using of robots is 
  raised. Suggestions by kids are discussed in a group. Each kid works on his 
  own idea. If he didn’t participate actively in discussion he or she is 
  suggested to implement one of the others' ideas that he understands.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">After completion of this phase robots are demonstrated and messages are 
  exchanged between kids. The task is to decode the unknown message. The 
  activity is manual, i.e. the kids try to decode message the message without a 
  robot as we only have the coding robot. The expectation is that some of the 
  kids will realize that much easier is to make a robot.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">Next step is to create a decoding robot or a robot that is universal 
  (coding/decoding). In this phase kids should feel more comfortable&nbsp; making 
  such types of robots.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">It is important for the teacher to try to connect the knowledge gained in 
  coding sessions with other already well known topics as sequences.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">Coding using sequences may be used as a continuation activity in further 
  series of sessions.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">Unlike other programs that overwhelm the student with rules we try to 
  introduce the coding subject gradually not following a hard line but listening 
  and following suggestions raised by kids. If the kids don’t respond actively 
  or the teacher thinks that it is too risky to deviate from the main session 
  plan he could keep to the session path as planned. He could postpone 
  unpredictable experimenting to later sessions when the necessary materials are 
  provided, and preliminary experimenting could be done. </p>
  <p class="mainbody">Students learn through straightforward, experiential learning, addressing 
  head-on the concepts that govern the coding and cryptography.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="paragraphheading">5. Expected results</h1>
  <p class="mainbody">At the end of the planned sessions the kids are expected to know and 
  understand the basic concepts of coding and its purpose in the world today.
  </p>
  <p class="mainbody">They should understand that the more complex the code is, the longer it 
  will take to work out, and develop the technical means to decode it. </p>
  <p><span class="mainbody">They should freely discuss and create simple code/decode systems using one 
  or a team of robots. </span><br>
